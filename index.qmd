# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book has been developed for **STAT 303-1 (Data Science with Python I), Section 20**, at Northwestern University.  

This edition is inspired by the foundational work of **Professor Arvind Krishna**, whose original materials helped shape the structure of this resource. The content has since been extensively revised to reflect current teaching goals and student needs.

In this first course of the sequence, students will be introduced to essential Python libraries for data science, including **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. We will then focus on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — learning how to transform messy, real-world datasets into meaningful insights through visualization, summarization, and pattern discovery.

- **Chapters 1–3** guide you through setting up your coding environment in VS Code, working with Jupyter Notebooks, and enhancing your workflow.  
- **Chapters 4–5** provide a concise review of prerequisite material from STAT 201. Students are expected to be familiar with this content or be prepared to learn it quickly.  
  - For a fuller review, please refer to the [STAT 201 ebook](https://lizhencontent** of the course begins in **Chapter 5 – *NumPy***.  

Throughout the quarter, the material will be continuously updated and refined to improve clarity, depth, and alignment with current teaching objectives.  

As a **living document**, this book welcomes feedback, suggestions, and contributions from students, instructors, and the broader academic community.  
Your input helps strengthen its quality and effectiveness.  

Thank you for being part of this journey — we hope this resource serves as a valuable guide in your learning.
