# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book has been developed for **STAT 303-1 (Data Science with Python I), Section 20**, at Northwestern University.  
This edition builds upon the foundational work of **Professor Arvind Krishna**, whose contributions have provided a strong framework for this resource.  

In this first course of the sequence, we will learn how to **read, process, and visualize data** using several popular Python libraries.  

- **Chapters 1–2** guide you through setting up your coding environment in VS Code, working with Jupyter Notebooks, and enhancing your workflow.  
- **Chapters 3–4** provide a concise review of prerequisite material from STAT 201. Students are expected to be familiar with this content or be prepared to learn it quickly.  
  - For a fuller review, please refer to the [STAT 201 ebook](https://lizhen0909.github.io/Intro_to_programming_for_data_sci/).  
- The **core content** of the course begins in **Chapter 5 – *Reading Data***.  

Throughout the quarter, the material will be continuously updated and refined to improve clarity, depth, and alignment with current teaching objectives.  

As a **living document**, this book welcomes feedback, suggestions, and contributions from students, instructors, and the broader academic community.  
Your input helps strengthen its quality and effectiveness.  

Thank you for being part of this journey — we hope this resource serves as a valuable guide in your learning.
