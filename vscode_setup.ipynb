    "  - Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense (auto-completion, code hints).  \n",
    "  - Built-in debugging tools.  \n",
    "  - Easy integration with virtual environments and Jupyter Notebooks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated Jupyter Notebook Support**  \n",
    "  You can open and run `.ipynb` notebooks directly in VS Code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customizable and Extensible**  \n",
    "  Large marketplace of extensions (e.g., formatting, linting, Git, Docker, AI tools).  \n",

    "Follow these steps to get your environment ready for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Install Python\n",
    "- Download and install the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org).  \n",
    "- On Windows, check the box **“Add Python to PATH.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2. Install VS Code\n",
    "- Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).  \n",

    "  - **Python (Microsoft)**  \n",
    "  - **Jupyter (Microsoft)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Create a Course Folder\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4. Create Your First Notebook\n",
    "- In VS Code, open the folder → **File → New File → Save as → `test.ipynb`**  \n",
    "- Add a code cell:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"hello world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Run the cell -> a Python environment window will pop up\n",

    "### 3. Set Up a Python Workspace for this course\n",
    "- Create a new folder for your course work (e.g., `STAT303-1` on Desktop or Documents).\n",
    "- Open the folder in VS Code (`File > Open Folder`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Create a Notebook for Your Work\n",
    "- In VS Code, go to `File > New File` and select `Jupyter Notebook`.\n",

    "     ![Alt Text](images/env_create_option.png):\n",
    "- Wait for Jupyter to start and install necessary components (e.g., ipykernel).\n",

    "*If you successfully created the environment using the GUI, skip the next step.*\n",

    "### 5B. Create a Virtual Environment using Command Line\n",
    "- If not prompted to create your environment, use the command line:\n",
    "  - Open the terminal in VS Code.\n",

    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    python -m venv .venv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Activate the environment:\n",

    "      ```bash\n",
    "      source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "  - You should see `(.venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.\n",

    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib\n",
    "    ```\n",
