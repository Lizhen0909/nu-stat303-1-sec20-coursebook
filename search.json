    "text": "1.1 Python language basics\n\n1.1.1 Object Oriented Programming\nPython is an object-oriented programming language. In layman terms, it means that every number, string, data structure, function, class, module, etc., exists in the python interpreter as a python object. An object may have attributes and methods associated with it. For example, let us define a variable that stores an integer:\n\nvar = 2\n\nThe variable var is an object that has attributes and methods associated with it. For example a couple of its attributes are real and imag, which store the real and imaginary parts respectively, of the object var:\n\nprint(\"Real part of 'var': \",var.real)\nprint(\"Real part of 'var': \",var.imag)\n\nReal part of 'var':  2\nReal part of 'var':  0\n\n\nAttribute: An attribute is a value associated with an object, defined within the class of the object.\nMethod: A method is a function associated with an object, defined within the class of the object, and has access to the attributes associated with the object.\nFor looking at attributes and methods associated with an object, say obj, press tab key after typing obj..\nConsider the example below of a class example_class:\n\nclass example_class:\n    class_name = 'My Class'\n    def my_method(self):\n        print('Hello World!')\n\ne = example_class()\n\nIn the above class, class_name is an attribute, while my_method is a method.\n\n\n1.1.2 Assigning variable name to object\n\n1.1.2.1 Call by reference\nPython utilizes a system, which is known as Call by Object Reference. When an object is assigned to a variable name, the variable name serves as a reference to the object. For example, consider the following assignment:\n\nx = [5,3]\n\nThe variable name x is a reference to the memory location where the object [5, 3] is stored. Now, suppose we assign x to a new variable y:\n\ny = x\n\nIn the above statement the variable name y now refers to the same object [5,3]. The object [5,3] does not get copied to a new memory location referred by y. To prove this, let us add an element to y:\n\ny.append(4)\nprint(y)\n\n[5, 3, 4]\n\n\n\nprint(x)\n\n[5, 3, 4]\n\n\nWhen we changed y, note that x also changed to the same object, showing that x and y refer to the same object, instead of referring to different copies of the same object.\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Assigning multiple variable names\nValues can be assigned to multiple variables in a single statement by separating the variable names and values with commas.\n\ncolor1, color2, color3 = \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"\n\n\ncolor1\n\n'red'\n\n\n\ncolor3\n\n'blue'\n\n\nThe same value can be assigned to multiple variables by chaining multiple assignment operations within a single statement.\n\ncolor4 = color5 = color6 = \"magenta\"\n\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Rules for variable names\nVariable names can be short (a, x, y, etc.) or descriptive ( my_favorite_color, profit_margin, the_3_musketeers, etc.). However, we recommend that you use descriptive variable names as it makes it easier to understand the code.\nThe rules below must be followed while naming Python variables:\n\nA variable’s name must start with a letter or the underscore character _. It cannot begin with a number.\nA variable name can only contain lowercase (small) or uppercase (capital) letters, digits, or underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _).\nVariable names are case-sensitive, i.e., a_variable, A_Variable, and A_VARIABLE are all different variables.\n\nHere are some valid variable names:\n\na_variable = 23\nis_today_Saturday = False\nmy_favorite_car = \"Delorean\"\nthe_3_musketeers = [\"Athos\", \"Porthos\", \"Aramis\"] \n\nLet’s try creating some variables with invalid names. Python prints a syntax error if the variable’s name is invalid.\n\nSyntax: The syntax of a programming language refers to the rules that govern the structure of a valid instruction or statement. If a statement does not follow these rules, Python stops execution and informs you that there is a syntax error. Syntax can be thought of as the rules of grammar for a programming language.\n\n\na variable = 23\n\n\nis_today_$aturday = False\n\n\nmy-favorite-car = \"Delorean\"\n\n\n3_musketeers = [\"Athos\", \"Porthos\", \"Aramis\"]\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Built-in objects\n\n1.1.3.1 Built-in data types\nVariable is created as soon as a value is assigned to it. We don’t have to define the type of variable explicitly as in other programming languages because Python can automatically guess the type of data entered (dynamically typed).\nAny data or information stored within a Python variable has a type. We can view the type of data stored within a variable using the type function.\n\na_variable\n\n23\n\n\n\ntype(a_variable)\n\nint\n\n\n\nis_today_Saturday\n\nFalse\n\n\n\ntype(is_today_Saturday)\n\nbool\n\n\n\nmy_favorite_car\n\n'Delorean'\n\n\n\ntype(my_favorite_car)\n\nstr\n\n\n\nthe_3_musketeers\n\n['Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis']\n\n\n\ntype(the_3_musketeers)\n\nlist\n\n\nPython has several built-in data types for storing different kinds of information in variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimitive: Integer, float, boolean, None, and string are primitive data types because they represent a single value.\nContainers: Other data types like list, tuple, and dictionary are often called data structures or containers because they hold multiple pieces of data together. We’ll discuss these datatypes in chapter 2.\nThe data type of the object can be identified using the in-built python function type(). For example, see the following objects and their types:\n\ntype(4)\n\nint\n\n\n\ntype(4.4)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\ntype('4')\n\nstr\n\n\n\ntype(True)\n\nbool\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3.2 Built-in modules and functions\nBuilt-in functions in Python are a set of predefined functions that are available for use without the need to import any additional libraries or modules. The Python Standard Library is very extensive. Besides built-in functions, it also contains many Python scripts (with the . py extension) containing useful utilities and modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.\nBelow are a couple of examples:\nrange(): The range() function returns a sequence of evenly-spaced integer values. It is commonly used in for loops to define the sequence of elements over which the iterations are performed.\nBelow is an example where the range() function is used to create a sequence of whole numbers upto 10:\n\nprint(list(range(1,10)))\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n\nThe advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).\nDate time: Python as a built-in datetime module for handling date/time objects:\n\nimport datetime as dt\n\n\n#Defining a date-time object \ndt_object = dt.datetime(2022, 9, 20, 11,30,0)\n\nInformation about date and time can be accessed with the relevant attribute of the datetime object.\n\ndt_object.day\n\n20\n\n\n\ndt_object.year\n\n2022\n\n\nThe strftime method of the datetime module formats a datetime object as a string. There are several types of formats for representing date as a string:\n\ndt_object.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')\n\n'09/20/2022'\n\n\n\ndt_object.strftime('%m/%d/%y %H:%M')\n\n'09/20/22 11:30'\n\n\n\ndt_object.strftime('%h-%d-%Y')\n\n'Sep-20-2022'\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Importing libraries\nThere are several built-in functions in python like print(), abs(), max(), sum() etc., which do not require importing any library. However, these functions will typically be insufficient for a analyzing data. Some of the popular libraries and their primary purposes are as follows:\n\nNumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions, making it essential for scientific and data analysis tasks.. It is mostly used for performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It offers data structures like DataFrames and Series, which facilitate data reading, cleaning, transformation, and analysis, making it indispensable in data science projects.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, or interactive plots and visualizations. It is commonly used for data visualization and exploration in data science. Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\nSciPy: SciPy is used for performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools for data pre-procesing, classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. It simplifies the implementation of machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.\nStatsmodels: Statsmodels is used for developing statistical models with a focus on inference (in contrast to focus on prediction as in scikit-learn).\n\nTo use libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn in Python, you typically need to follow these steps:\n\nInstall the libraries (Anaconda already does this)\nImport the libraries in the python script or jupyter notebook\nUse the Library Functions and Classes: After importing the libraries, you can use their functions, classes, and methods in your code. For instance, you can create NumPy arrays, manipulate data with pandas, create plots with Matplotlib, or train machine learning models with scikit-learn.\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nThere’s different ways to import:\n\nImport the whole module using its original name:  import math, os\nImport specific things from the module:  from random import randint  from math import pi\nImport the whole library and rename it, usually using a shorter variable name:  import pandas as pd\nImport a specific method from the module and rename it as it is imported:  from os.path import join as join_path\n\n\n\n1.1.5 User-defined functions\nA function is a reusable set of instructions that takes one or more inputs, performs some operations, and often returns an output. Indeed, while python’s standard library and ecosystem libraries offer a wealth of pre-defined functions for a wide range of tasks, there are situations where defining your own functions is not just beneficial but necessary. \n\n1.1.5.1 Creating and using functions\nYou can define a new function using the def keyword.\n\ndef say_hello():\n    print('Hello there!')\n    print('How are you?')\n\nNote the round brackets or parentheses () and colon : after the function’s name. Both are essential parts of the syntax. The function’s body contains an indented block of statements. The statements inside a function’s body are not executed when the function is defined. To execute the statements, we need to call or invoke the function.\n\nsay_hello()\n\nHello there!\nHow are you?\n\n\n\ndef say_hello_to(name):\n    print('Hello ', name)\n    print('How are you?')\n\n\nsay_hello_to('Lizhen')\n\nHello  Lizhen\nHow are you?\n\n\n\nname = input ('Please enter your name: ')\nsay_hello_to(name)\n\nPlease enter your name: George\nHello  George\nHow are you?\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 Variable scope: Local and global Variables\nLocal variable: When we declare variables inside a function, these variables will have a local scope (within the function). We cannot access them outside the function. These types of variables are called local variables. For example,\n\ndef greet(): \n    message = 'Hello'  # local variable\n    print('Local', message)\ngreet()\n\nLocal Hello\n\n\n\nprint(message) # try to access message variable outside greet() function\n\nNameError: name 'message' is not defined\n\n\nAs message was defined within the function greet(), it is local to the function, and cannot be called outside the function.\nGlobal variable: Aa variable declared outside of the function or in global scope is known as a global variable. This means that a global variable can be accessed inside or outside of the function.\nLet’s see an example of how a global variable is created.\n\nmessage = 'Hello'  # declare global variable\n\ndef greet():\n    print('Local', message)  # declare local variable\n\ngreet()\nprint('Global', message)\n\nLocal Hello\nGlobal Hello\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5.3 Named arguments\nInvoking a function with many arguments can often get confusing and is prone to human errors. Python provides the option of invoking functions with named arguments for better clarity. You can also split function invocation into multiple lines.\n\ndef loan_emi(amount, duration, rate, down_payment=0):\n    loan_amount = amount - down_payment\n    emi = loan_amount * rate * ((1+rate)**duration) / (((1+rate)**duration)-1)\n    return emi\n\n\nemi1 = loan_emi(\n    amount=1260000, \n    duration=8*12, \n    rate=0.1/12, \n    down_payment=3e5\n)\n\n\nemi1\n\n14567.19753389219\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5.4 Optional Arguments\nFunctions with optional arguments offer more flexibility in how you can use them. You can call the function with or without the argument, and if there is no argument in the function call, then a default value is used.\n\nemi2 = loan_emi(\n    amount=1260000, \n    duration=8*12, \n    rate=0.1/12)\n\nemi2\n\n19119.4467632335\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5.5 *args and **kwargs\nWe can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:\n\nSpecial Symbols Used for passing arguments: 1. *args (Non-Keyword Arguments) 2. *kwargs (Keyword Arguments) &gt; Note: “We use the “wildcard” or “” notation like this – *args OR **kwargs – as our function’s argument when we have doubts about the number of arguments we should pass in a function.”\n\ndef myFun(*args,**kwargs):\n    print(\"args: \", args)\n    print(\"kwargs: \", kwargs)\n \n \n# Now we can use both *args ,**kwargs\n# to pass arguments to this function :\nmyFun('John',22,'cs',name=\"John\",age=22,major=\"cs\")\n\nargs:  ('John', 22, 'cs')\nkwargs:  {'name': 'John', 'age': 22, 'major': 'cs'}\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6 Branching and looping (control flow)\n\nAs in other languages, python has built-in keywords that provide conditional flow of control in the code.\n\n1.1.6.1 Branching with if, else and elif\nOne of the most powerful features of programming languages is branching: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\nThe if statement\nIn Python, branching is implemented using the if statement, which is written as follows:\nif condition:\n    statement1\n    statement2\nThe condition can be a value, variable or expression. If the condition evaluates to True, then the statements within the if block are executed. Notice the four spaces before statement1, statement2, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the if statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called indentation.\n\nIndentation: Python relies heavily on indentation (white space before a statement) to define code structure. This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don’t use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the Tab key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing Tab again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press Shift+Tab will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces.\n\nFor example, let’s write some code to check and print a message if a given number is even.\n\na_number = 34\n\n\nif a_number % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"We're inside an if block\")\n    print('The given number {} is even.'.format(a_number))\n\nWe're inside an if block\nThe given number 34 is even.\n\n\nThe else statement\nWe may want to print a different message if the number is not even in the above example. This can be done by adding the else statement. It is written as follows:\nif condition:\n    statement1\n    statement2\nelse:\n    statement4\n    statement5\n\nIf condition evaluates to True, the statements in the if block are executed. If it evaluates to False, the statements in the else block are executed.\n\nif a_number % 2 == 0:\n    print('The given number {} is even.'.format(a_number))\nelse:\n    print('The given number {} is odd.'.format(a_number))\n\nThe given number 34 is even.\n\n\nThe elif statement\nPython also provides an elif statement (short for “else if”) to chain a series of conditional blocks. The conditions are evaluated one by one. For the first condition that evaluates to True, the block of statements below it is executed. The remaining conditions and statements are not evaluated. So, in an if, elif, elif… chain, at most one block of statements is executed, the one corresponding to the first condition that evaluates to True.\n\ntoday = 'Wednesday'\n\n\nif today == 'Sunday':\n    print(\"Today is the day of the sun.\")\nelif today == 'Monday':\n    print(\"Today is the day of the moon.\")\nelif today == 'Tuesday':\n    print(\"Today is the day of Tyr, the god of war.\")\nelif today == 'Wednesday':\n    print(\"Today is the day of Odin, the supreme diety.\")\nelif today == 'Thursday':\n    print(\"Today is the day of Thor, the god of thunder.\")\nelif today == 'Friday':\n    print(\"Today is the day of Frigga, the goddess of beauty.\")\nelif today == 'Saturday':\n    print(\"Today is the day of Saturn, the god of fun and feasting.\")\n\nToday is the day of Odin, the supreme diety.\n\n\nIn the above example, the first 3 conditions evaluate to False, so none of the first 3 messages are printed. The fourth condition evaluates to True, so the corresponding message is printed. The remaining conditions are skipped. Try changing the value of today above and re-executing the cells to print all the different messages.\nUsing if, elif, and else together\nYou can also include an else statement at the end of a chain of if, elif… statements. This code within the else block is evaluated when none of the conditions hold true.\n\na_number = 49\n\n\nif a_number % 2 == 0:\n    print('{} is divisible by 2'.format(a_number))\nelif a_number % 3 == 0:\n    print('{} is divisible by 3'.format(a_number))\nelif a_number % 5 == 0:\n    print('{} is divisible by 5'.format(a_number))\nelse:\n    print('All checks failed!')\n    print('{} is not divisible by 2, 3 or 5'.format(a_number))\n\nAll checks failed!\n49 is not divisible by 2, 3 or 5\n\n\nNon-Boolean Conditions\nNote that conditions do not necessarily have to be booleans. In fact, a condition can be any value. The value is converted into a boolean automatically using the bool operator. Any value in Python can be converted to a Boolean using the bool function.\nOnly the following values evaluate to False (they are often called falsy values):\n\nThe value False itself\nThe integer 0\nThe float 0.0\nThe empty value None\nThe empty text \"\"\nThe empty list []\nThe empty tuple ()\nThe empty dictionary {}\nThe empty set set()\nThe empty range range(0)\n\nEverything else evaluates to True (a value that evaluates to True is often called a truthy value).\n\nif '':\n    print('The condition evaluted to True')\nelse:\n    print('The condition evaluted to False')\n\nThe condition evaluted to False\n\n\n\nif 'Hello':\n    print('The condition evaluted to True')\nelse:\n    print('The condition evaluted to False')\n\nThe condition evaluted to True\n\n\n\nif { 'a': 34 }:\n    print('The condition evaluted to True')\nelse:\n    print('The condition evaluted to False')\n\nThe condition evaluted to True\n\n\n\nif None:\n    print('The condition evaluted to True')\nelse:\n    print('The condition evaluted to False')\n\nThe condition evaluted to False\n\n\nNested conditional statements\nThe code inside an if block can also include an if statement inside it. This pattern is called nesting and is used to check for another condition after a particular condition holds true.\n\na_number = 15\n\n\nif a_number % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"{} is even\".format(a_number))\n    if a_number % 3 == 0:\n        print(\"{} is also divisible by 3\".format(a_number))\n    else:\n        print(\"{} is not divisibule by 3\".format(a_number))\nelse:\n    print(\"{} is odd\".format(a_number))\n    if a_number % 5 == 0:\n        print(\"{} is also divisible by 5\".format(a_number))\n    else:\n        print(\"{} is not divisibule by 5\".format(a_number))\n\n15 is odd\n15 is also divisible by 5\n\n\nNotice how the print statements are indented by 8 spaces to indicate that they are part of the inner if/else blocks.\n\nNested if, else statements are often confusing to read and prone to human error. It’s good to avoid nesting whenever possible, or limit the nesting to 1 or 2 levels.\n\nShorthand if conditional expression\nA frequent use case of the if statement involves testing a condition and setting a variable’s value based on the condition.\nPython provides a shorter syntax, which allows writing such conditions in a single line of code. It is known as a conditional expression, sometimes also referred to as a ternary operator. It has the following syntax:\nx = true_value if condition else false_value\nIt has the same behavior as the following if-else block:\nif condition:\n    x = true_value\nelse:\n    x = false_value\nLet’s try it out for the example above.\n\nparity = 'even' if a_number % 2 == 0 else 'odd'\n\n\nprint('The number {} is {}.'.format(a_number, parity))\n\nThe number 15 is odd.\n\n\nThe pass statement\nif statements cannot be empty, there must be at least one statement in every if and elif block. We can use the pass statement to do nothing and avoid getting an error.\n\na_number = 9\n\n\nif a_number % 2 == 0:\n    \nelif a_number % 3 == 0:\n    print('{} is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2')\n\nIndentationError: expected an indented block (1562158884.py, line 3)\n\n\nAs there must be at least one statement withihng the if block, the above code throws an error.\n\nif a_number % 2 == 0:\n    pass\nelif a_number % 3 == 0:\n    print('{} is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2'.format(a_number))\n\n9 is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6.2 Iteration with while loops\nAnother powerful feature of programming languages, closely related to branching, is running one or more statements multiple times. This feature is often referred to as iteration on looping, and there are two ways to do this in Python: using while loops and for loops.\nwhile loops have the following syntax:\nwhile condition:\n    statement(s)\nStatements in the code block under while are executed repeatedly as long as the condition evaluates to True. Generally, one of the statements under while makes some change to a variable that causes the condition to evaluate to False after a certain number of iterations.\nLet’s try to calculate the factorial of 100 using a while loop. The factorial of a number n is the product (multiplication) of all the numbers from 1 to n, i.e., 1*2*3*...*(n-2)*(n-1)*n.\n\nresult = 1\ni = 1\n\nwhile i &lt;= 10:\n    result = result * i\n    i = i+1\n\nprint('The factorial of 100 is: {}'.format(result))\n\nThe factorial of 100 is: 3628800\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6.3 Infinite Loops\nSuppose the condition in a while loop always holds true. In that case, Python repeatedly executes the code within the loop forever, and the execution of the code never completes. This situation is called an infinite loop. It generally indicates that you’ve made a mistake in your code. For example, you may have provided the wrong condition or forgotten to update a variable within the loop, eventually falsifying the condition.\nIf your code is stuck in an infinite loop during execution, just press the “Stop” button on the toolbar (next to “Run”) or select “Kernel &gt; Interrupt” from the menu bar. This will interrupt the execution of the code. The following two cells both lead to infinite loops and need to be interrupted.\n\n# INFINITE LOOP - INTERRUPT THIS CELL\n\nresult = 1\ni = 1\n\nwhile i &lt;= 100:\n    result = result * i\n    # forgot to increment i\n\n\n# INFINITE LOOP - INTERRUPT THIS CELL\n\nresult = 1\ni = 1\n\nwhile i &gt; 0 : # wrong condition\n    result *= i\n    i += 1\n\n\n\n1.1.6.4 break and continue statements\nIn Python, break and continue statements can alter the flow of a normal loop. \nWe can use the break statement within the loop’s body to immediately stop the execution and break out of the loop. with the continue statement. If the condition evaluates to True, then the loop will move to the next iteration.\n\ni = 1\nresult = 1\n\nwhile i &lt;= 100:\n    result *= i\n    if i == 42:\n        print('Magic number 42 reached! Stopping execution..')\n        break\n    i += 1\n    \nprint('i:', i)\nprint('result:', result)\n\nMagic number 42 reached!

As our programs get larger, they naturally become prone to human errors. Logging can help in verifying the program is working as expected.

For loops have the following syntax:\nfor value in sequence:\n    statement(s)\nThe statements within the loop are executed once for each element in sequence. Here’s an example that prints all the element of a list.\n\ndays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']\n\nfor day in days:\n    print(day)\n\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\n\n\n\n# Looping over a string\nfor char in 'Monday':\n    print(char)\n\nM\no\nn\nd\na\ny\n\n\n\n# Looping over a dictionary\nperson = {\n    'name': 'John Doe',\n    'sex': 'Male',\n    'age': 32,\n    'married': True\n}\n\nfor key, value in person.items():\n    print(\"Key:\", key, \",\", \"Value:\", value)\n\nKey: name , Value: John Doe\nKey: sex , Value: Male\nKey: age , Value: 32\nKey: married , Value: True\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.7 Iterating using range and enumerate\nThe range function is used to create a sequence of numbers that can be iterated over using a for loop. It can be used in 3 ways:\n\nrange(n) - Creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1\nrange(a, b) - Creates a sequence of numbers from a to b-1\nrange(a, b, step) - Creates a sequence of numbers from a to b-1 with increments of step\n\nLet’s try it out.\n\nfor i in range(4):\n    print(i)\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\nfor i in range(3, 8):\n    print(i)\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n\nfor i in range(3, 14, 4):\n    print(i)\n\n3\n7\n11\n\n\nRanges are used for iterating over lists when you need to track the index of elements while iterating.\n\na_list = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n    print('The value at position {} is {}.'.format(i, a_list[i]))\n\nThe value at position 0 is Monday.\nThe value at position 1 is Tuesday.\nThe value at position 2 is Wednesday.\nThe value at position 3 is Thursday.\nThe value at position 4 is Friday.\n\n\nAnother way to achieve the same result is by using the enumerate function with a_list as an input, which returns a tuple containing the index and the corresponding element.\n\nfor i, val in enumerate(a_list):\n    print('The value at position {} is {}.'.format(i, val))\n\nThe value at position 0 is Monday.\nThe value at position 1 is Tuesday.\nThe value at position 2 is Wednesday.\nThe value at position 3 is Thursday.\nThe value at position 4 is Friday."

    "text": "2.1 Tuple\nTuple is a sequence of python objects, with two key characteristics: (1) the number of objects are fixed, and (2) the objects are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed.\nTuple can be defined as a sequence of python objects separated by commas, and enclosed in rounded brackets (). For example, below is a tuple containing three integers.\n\ntuple_example = (2,7,4)\n\nWe can check the data type of a python object using the in-built python function type(). Let us check the data type of the object tuple_example.\n\ntype(tuple_example)\n\ntuple\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Tuple Indexing\nTuple is ordered, meaning you can access specific elements in a list using their index. Indexing in lists includes both positive indexing (starting from 0 for the first element) and negative indexing (starting from -1 for the last element).\n\nElements of a tuple can be extracted using their index within square brackets. For example the second element of the tuple tuple_example can be extracted as follows:\n\ntuple_example[1]\n\n7\n\n\n\ntuple_example[-1]\n\n4\n\n\nNote that an element of a tuple cannot be modified. For example, consider the following attempt in changing the second element of the tuple tuple_example.\n\ntuple_example[1] = 8\n\nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n\n\nThe above code results in an error as tuple elements cannot be modified.\n\n\n2.1.2 Concatenating tuples\nTuples can be concatenated using the + operator to produce a longer tuple:\n\n(2,7,4) + (\"another\", \"tuple\") + (\"mixed\",\"datatypes\",5)\n\n(2, 7, 4, 'another', 'tuple', 'mixed', 'datatypes', 5)\n\n\nMultiplying a tuple by an integer results in repetition of the tuple:\n\n(2,7,\"hi\") * 3\n\n(2, 7, 'hi', 2, 7, 'hi', 2, 7, 'hi')\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Unpacking tuples\nIf tuples are assigned to an expression containing multiple variables, the tuple will be unpacked and each variable will be assigned a value as per the order in which it appears. See the example below.\n\nx,y,z  = (4.5, \"this is a string\", ((\"Nested tuple\",5)))\n\n\nx\n\n4.5\n\n\n\ny\n\n'this is a string'\n\n\n\nz\n\n('Nested tuple', 5)\n\n\nIf we are interested in retrieving only some values of the tuple, the expression *_ can be used to discard the other values. Let’s say we are interested in retrieving only the first and the last two values of the tuple:\n\nx,*_,y,z  = (4.5, \"this is a string\", ((\"Nested tuple\",5)),\"99\",99)\n\n\nx\n\n4.5\n\n\n\ny\n\n'99'\n\n\n\nz\n\n99\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Tuple methods\nA couple of useful tuple methods are count, which counts the occurrences of an element in the tuple and index, which returns the position of the first occurrence of an element in the tuple:\n\ntuple_example = (2,5,64,7,2,2)\n\n\ntuple_example.count(2)\n\n3\n\n\n\ntuple_example.index(2)\n\n0\n\n\nNow that we have an idea about tuple, let us try to think where it can be used."

    "section": "2.2 List",
    "text": "2.2 List\nList is a sequence of python objects, with two key characeterisics that differentiates it from tuple: (1) the number of objects are variable, i.e., objects can be added or removed from a list, and (2) the objects are mutable, i.e., they can be changed.\nList can be defined as a sequence of python objects separated by commas, and enclosed in square brackets []. For example, below is a list consisting of three integers.\n\nlist_example = [2,7,4]\n\nList indexing works the same way as tuple indexing.\n\n2.2.1 Slicing a list\nList slicing is a technique in Python that allows you to extract a portion of a list by specifying a range of indices. It creates a new list containing the elements from the original list within that specified range. List slicing uses the colon : operator to indicate the start, stop, and step values for the slice. The general syntax is:  new_list = original_list[start:stop:step]\nHere’s what each part of the slice means: * start: The index at which the slice begins (inclusive). If omitted, it starts from the beginning (index 0). * stop: The index at which the slice ends (exclusive). If omitted, it goes until the end of the list. * step: The interval between elements in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to 1.\n\nlist_example6 = [4,7,3,5,7,1,5,87,5]\n\nLet us extract a slice containing all the elements from the the 3rd position to the 7th position.\n\nlist_example6[2:7]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\nNote that while the element at the start index is included, the element with the stop index is excluded in the above slice.\nIf either the start or stop index is not mentioned, the slicing will be done from the beginning or until the end of the list, respectively.\n\nlist_example6[:7]\n\n[4, 7, 3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[2:]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\nTo slice the list relative to the end, we can use negative indices:\n\nlist_example6[-4:]\n\n[1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[-4:-2:]\n\n[1, 5]\n\n\nAn extra colon (‘:’) can be used to slice every \\(n\\)th element of a list.\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list\nlist_example6[::3]\n\n[4, 5, 5]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list from the end\nlist_example6[::-3]\n\n[5, 1, 3]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every element of a list from the end or reversing a list \nlist_example6[::-1]\n\n[5, 87, 5, 1, 7, 5, 3, 7, 4]\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Adding and removing elements in a list\nWe can add elements at the end of the list using the append method. For example, we append the string ‘red’ to the list list_example below.\n\nlist_example.append('red')\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 7, 4, 'red']\n\n\nNote that the objects of a list or a tuple can be of different datatypes.\nAn element can be added at a specific location of the list using the insert method. For example, if we wish to insert the number 2.32 as the second element of the list list_example, we can do it as follows:\n\nlist_example.insert(1,2.32)\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 7, 4, 'red']\n\n\nFor removing an element from the list, the pop and remove methods may be used. The pop method removes an element at a particular index, while the remove method removes the element’s first occurence in the list by its value. See the examples below.\nLet us say, we need to remove the third element of the list.\n\nlist_example.pop(2)\n\n7\n\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 4, 'red']\n\n\nLet us say, we need to remove the element ‘red’.\n\nlist_example.remove('red')\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 4]\n\n\n\n#If there are multiple occurrences of an element in the list, the first occurence will be removed\nlist_example2 = [2,3,2,4,4]\nlist_example2.remove(2)\nlist_example2\n\n[3, 2, 4, 4]\n\n\nFor removing multiple elements in a list, either pop or remove can be used in a for loop, or a for loop can be used with a condition. See the examples below.\nLet’s say we need to remove intergers less than 100 from the following list.\n\nlist_example3 = list(range(95,106))\nlist_example3\n\n[95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\n#Method 1: For loop with remove, iterating over the elements of the original list, \n#but updating a copy of the original list\nlist_example3_filtered = list(list_example3) #\nfor element in list_example3:\n    if element&lt;100:\n        list_example3_filtered.remove(element)\nprint(list_example3_filtered)\n\n[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Q1}}\\): What’s the need to define a new variable list_example3_filtered in the above code?\n\\(\\color{blue}{\\text{A1}}\\): Replace list_example3_filtered with list_example3 and identify the issue. After an element is removed from the list, all the elements that come afterward have their index/position reduced by one. After the elment 95 is removed, 96 is at index 0, but the for loop will now look at the element at index 1, which is now 97. So, iterating over the same list that is being updated in the loop will keep 96 and 98. Using a new list gets rid of the issue by keeping the original list unchanged, so the for-loop iterates over all elements of the original list.\nAnother method could have been to interate over a copy of the original list and update the original list as shown below.\n\n#Method 2: For loop with remove, iterating over the elements of a copy of the original list, \n#but updating the original list\nfor element in list_example3[:]: #Slicing a list creates a new list, thus the loop is iterating over elements of a copy of the original list as all the elements are selected in the slicing\n    if element&lt;100:\n        list_example3.remove(element)\nprint(list_example3)\n\n[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\nBelow is another method that uses a shorthand notation - list comprehension (explained in the next section).\n\n#Method 3: For loop with condition in list comprehension\nlist_example3 = list(range(95,106))\n[element for element in list_example3 if element&gt;=100]\n\n[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 List comprehensions\nList comprehensions provide a concise and readable way to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or range) and optionally filtering the items based on a condition. They are a powerful and efficient way to generate lists without the need for explicit loops. The basic syntax of a list comprehension is as follows:\nnew_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n\nexpression: This is the expression that is applied to each item in the iterable. It defines what will be included in the new list.\nitem: This is a variable that represents each element in the iterable as the comprehension iterates through it.\niterable: This is the source from which the elements are taken. It can be any iterable, such as a list, tuple, range, or other iterable objects.\ncondition (optional): This is an optional filter that can be applied to control which items from the iterable are included in the new list. If omitted, all items from the iterable are included.\n\nExample: Create a list that has squares of natural numbers from 5 to 15.\n\nsqrt_natural_no_5_15 = [(x**2) for x in range(5,16)]\nprint(sqrt_natural_no_5_15)\n\n[25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225]\n\n\nExample: Create a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a natural number and its square, for natural numbers ranging from 5 to 15.\n\nsqrt_natural_no_5_15 = [(x,x**2) for x in range(5,16)]\nprint(sqrt_natural_no_5_15)\n\n[(5, 25), (6, 36), (7, 49), (8, 64), (9, 81), (10, 100), (11, 121), (12, 144), (13, 169), (14, 196), (15, 225)]\n\n\nExample: Creating a list of words that start with the letter ‘a’ in a given list of words.\n\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'avocado', 'grape', 'apricot']\na_words = [word for word in words if word.startswith('a')]\nprint(a_words)\n\n['apple', 'avocado', 'apricot']\n\n\nExample: Create a list of even numbers from 1 to 20.\n\neven_numbers = [x for x in range(1, 21) if x % 2 == 0]\nprint(even_numbers)\n\n[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]\n\n\nList comprehensions are not only concise but also considered more Pythonic and often more efficient than using explicit loops for simple operations. They can make your code cleaner and easier to read, especially for operations that transform or filter data in a list.\n\n\n2.2.4 Practice exercise 1\nBelow is a list consisting of responses to the question: “At what age do you think you will marry?” from students of the STAT303-1 Fall 2022 class.\n\nexp_marriage_age=['24','30','28','29','30','27','26','28','30+','26','28','30','30','30','probably never','30','25','25','30','28','30+ ','30','25','28','28','25','25','27','28','30','30','35','26','28','27','27','30','25','30','26','32','27','26','27','26','28','37','28','28','28','35','28','27','28','26','28','26','30','27','30','28','25','26','28','35','29','27','27','30','24','25','29','27','33','30','30','25','26','30','32','26','30','30','I wont','25','27','27','25','27','27','32','26','25','never','28','33','28','35','25','30','29','30','31','28','28','30','40','30','28','30','27','by 30','28','27','28','30-35','35','30','30','never','30','35','28','31','30','27','33','32','27','27','26','N/A','25','26','29','28','34','26','24','28','30','120','25','33','27','28','32','30','26','30','30','28','27','27','27','27','27','27','28','30','30','30','28','30','28','30','30','28','28','30','27','30','28','25','never','69','28','28','33','30','28','28','26','30','26','27','30','25','Never','27','27','25']\n\nUse list comprehension to:\n\n2.2.4.1 \nRemove the elements that are not integers - such as ‘probably never’, ‘30+’, etc. What is the length of the new list?\nHint: The built-in python function of the str class - isdigit() may be useful to check if the string contains only digits.\nSolution:\n\nexp_marriage_age_num = [x for x in exp_marriage_age if x.isdigit()==True]\nprint(\"Length of the new list = \",len(exp_marriage_age_num))\n\nLength of the new list =  181\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4.2 \nCap the values greater than 80 to 80, in the clean list obtained in (1).

Do the following:\n\n2.2.8.1 \nSet the second entry (index 1) to 17\n\nL = [8,9,10]\nL[1]=17\n\n\n\n2.2.8.2 \nAdd 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list\n\nL = L+[4,5,6]\n\n\n\n2.2.8.3 \nRemove the first entry from the list\n\nL.pop(0)\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n2.2.8.4 \nSort the list\n\nL.sort()\n\n\n\n2.2.8.5 \nDouble the list (concatenate the list to itself)\n\nL=L+L\n\n\n\n2.2.8.6 \nInsert 25 at index 3\nThe final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17]\n\nL.insert(3,25)\nL\n\n[4, 5, 6, 25, 10, 17, 4, 5, 6, 10, 17]\n\n\nNow that we have an idea about lists, let us try to think where it can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.9 Other list operations\nYou can test whether a list contains a value using the in operator.\n\nlist_example6\n\n[4, 7, 3, 5, 7, 1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\n\n6 in list_example6\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n7 in list_example6\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n2.2.10 Lists: methods\nJust like strings, there are several in-built methods to manipulate a list. However, unlike strings, most list methods modify the original list rather than returning a new one. Here are some common list operations: \n\n\n\n2.2.11 Lists vs tuples\nNow that we have learned about lists and tuples, let us compare them.\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Q2}}\\): A list seems to be much more flexible than tuple, and can replace a tuple almost everywhere. Then why use tuple at all?\n\\(\\color{blue}{\\text{A2}}\\): The additional flexibility of a list comes at the cost of efficiency. Some of the advantages of a tuple over a list are as follows:\n\nSince a list can be extended, space is over-allocated when creating a list. A tuple takes less storage space as compared to a list of the same length.\nTuples are not copied. If a tuple is assigned to another tuple, both tuples point to the same memory location. However, if a list is assigned to another list, a new list is created consuming the same memory space as the original list.\nTuples refer to their element directly, while in a list, there is an extra layer of pointers that refers to their elements. Thus it is faster to retrieve elements from a tuple.\n\nThe examples below illustrate the above advantages of a tuple.\n\n#Example showing tuples take less storage space than lists for the same elements\ntuple_ex = (1, 2, 'Obama')\nlist_ex = [1, 2, 'Obama']\nprint(\"Space taken by tuple =\",tuple_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\nprint(\"Space taken by list =\",list_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\n\nSpace taken by tuple = 48  bytes\nSpace taken by list = 64  bytes\n\n\n\n#Examples showing that a tuples are not copied, while lists can be copied\ntuple_copy = tuple(tuple_ex)\nprint(\"Is tuple_copy same as tuple_ex?\", tuple_ex is tuple_copy)\nlist_copy = list(list_ex)\nprint(\"Is list_copy same as list_ex?\",list_ex is list_copy)\n\nIs tuple_copy same as tuple_ex? True\nIs list_copy same as list_ex? False\n\n\n\n#Examples showing tuples takes lesser time to retrieve elements\nimport time as tm\ntt = tm.time()\nlist_ex = list(range(1000000)) #List containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(list_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\ntt = tm.time()\ntuple_ex = tuple(range(1000000)) #tuple containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(tuple_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list =  0.03579902648925781\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple =  0.02684164047241211"

    "text": "2.3 Dictionary\nUnlike lists and tuples, a dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item stored in a dictionary has a key and value. You can use a key to retrieve the corresponding value from the dictionary. Dictionaries have the type dict.\nDictionaries are often used to store many pieces of information e.g. details about a person, in a single variable. Dictionaries are created by enclosing key-value pairs within braces or curly brackets { and }, colons to separate keys and values, and commas to separate elements of a dictionary.\nThe dictionary keys and values are python objects. While values can be any python object, keys need to be immutable python objects, like strings, integers, tuples, etc. Thus, a list can be a value, but not a key, as elements of list can be changed.\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping'}\n\nElements of a dictionary can be retrieved by using the corresponding key.\n\ndict_example['India']\n\n'Narendra Modi'\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Viewing keys and values\n\ndict_example.keys()\n\ndict_keys(['USA', 'India', 'China'])\n\n\n\ndict_example.values()\n\ndict_values(['Joe Biden', 'Narendra Modi', 'Xi Jinping'])\n\n\n\ndict_example.items()\n\ndict_items([('USA', 'Joe Biden'), ('India', 'Narendra Modi'), ('China', 'Xi Jinping')])\n\n\nThe results of keys, values, and items look like lists. However, they don’t support the indexing operator [] for retrieving elements.\n\ndict_example.items()[1]\n\nTypeError: 'dict_items' object is not subscriptable\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Adding and removing elements in a dictionary\nNew elements can be added to a dictionary by defining a key in square brackets and assiging it to a value:\n\ndict_example['Japan'] = 'Fumio Kishida'\ndict_example['Countries'] = 4\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida',\n 'Countries': 4}\n\n\nElements can be removed from the dictionary using the del method or the pop method:\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'Countries'\ndel dict_example['Countries']\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'USA'\ndict_example.pop('USA')\n\n'Joe Biden'\n\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'India': 'Narendra Modi', 'China': 'Xi Jinping', 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\nNew elements can be added, and values of exisiting keys can be changed using the update method:\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping','Countries':3}\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 3}\n\n\n\ndict_example.update({'Countries':4, 'Japan':'Fumio Kishida'})\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 4,\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Iterating over elements of a dictionary\nThe items() attribute of a dictionary can be used to iterate over elements of a dictionary.\n\nfor key,value in dict_example.items():\n    print(\"The Head of State of\",key,\"is\",value)\n\nThe Head of State of USA is Joe Biden\nThe Head of State of India is Narendra Modi\nThe Head of State of China is Xi Jinping\nThe Head of State of Countries is 4\nThe Head of State of Japan is Fumio Kishida\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Practice exercise 4\nThe GDP per capita of USA for most years from 1960 to 2021 is given by the dictionary D given in the code cell below.\nFind:\n\nThe GDP per capita in 2015\nThe GDP per capita of 2014 is missing.

    "section": "2.4 Functions",
    "text": "2.4 Functions\nIf an algorithm or block of code is being used several times in a code, then it can be separately defined as a function. This makes the code more organized and readable. For example, let us define a function that prints prime numbers between a and b, and returns the number of prime numbers found.\n\n#Function definition\ndef prime_numbers (a,b=100):\n    num_prime_nos = 0\n    \n    #Iterating over all numbers between a and b\n    for i in range(a,b):\n        num_divisors=0\n        \n        #Checking if the ith number has any factors\n        for j in range(2, i):\n            if i%j == 0:\n                num_divisors=1;break;\n                \n        #If there are no factors, then printing and counting the number as prime        \n        if num_divisors==0:\n            print(i)\n            num_prime_nos = num_prime_nos+1\n            \n    #Return count of the number of prime numbers\n    return num_prime_nos\n\nIn the above function, the keyword def is used to define the function, prime_numbers is the name of the function, a and b are the arguments that the function uses to compute the output.\nLet us use the defined function to print and count the prime numbers between 40 and 60.\n\n#Printing prime numbers between 40 and 60\nnum_prime_nos_found = prime_numbers(40,60)\n\n41\n43\n47\n53\n59\n\n\n\nnum_prime_nos_found\n\n5\n\n\nIf the user calls the function without specifying the value of the argument b, then it will take the default value of 100, as mentioned in the function definition. However, for the argument a, the user will need to specify a value, as there is no value defined as a default value in the function definition.\n\n2.4.1 Global and local variables with respect to a function\nA variable defined within a function is local to that function, while a variable defined outside the function is global to that function. In case a variable with the same name is defined both outside and inside a function, it will refer to its global value outside the function and local value within the function.\nThe example below shows a variable with the name var referring to its local value when called within the function, and global value when called outside the function.\n\nvar = 5\ndef sample_function(var):    \n    print(\"Local value of 'var' within 'sample_function()'= \",var)\n\nsample_function(4)\nprint(\"Global value of 'var' outside 'sample_function()' = \",var)\n\nLocal value of 'var' within 'sample_function()'=  4\nGlobal value of 'var' outside 'sample_function()' =  5\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Practice exercise 5\nThe object deck defined below corresponds to a deck of cards. Estimate the probablity that a five card hand will be a flush, as follows:\n\nWrite a function that accepts a hand of 5 cards as argument, and returns whether the hand is a flush or not.\nRandomly pull a hand of 5 cards from the deck. Call the function developed in (1) to determine if the hand is a flush.\nRepeat (2) 10,000 times.\nEstimate the probability of the hand being a flush from the results of the 10,000 simulations.\n\nYou may use the function shuffle() from the random library to shuffle the deck everytime before pulling a hand of 5 cards.\n\ndeck = [{'value':i, 'suit':c}\nfor c in ['spades', 'clubs', 'hearts', 'diamonds']\nfor i in range(2,15)]\n\nSolution:\n\nimport random as rm\n\n#Function to check if a 5-card hand is a flush\ndef chck_flush(hands):  \n    \n    #Assuming that the hand is a flush, before checking the cards\n    yes_flush =1\n    \n    #Storing the suit of the first card in 'first_suit'\n    first_suit = hands[0]['suit']\n    \n    #Iterating over the remaining 4 cards of the hand\n    for j in range(1,len(hands)):\n        \n        #If the suit of any of the cards does not match the suit of the first card, the hand is not a flush\n        if first_suit!=hands[j]['suit']:\n            yes_flush = 0; \n            \n            #As soon as a card with a different suit is found, the hand is not a flush and there is no need to check other cards. So, we 'break' out of the loop\n            break;\n    return yes_flush\n\nflush=0\nfor i in range(10000):\n    \n    #Shuffling the deck\n    rm.shuffle(deck)\n    \n    #Picking out the first 5 cards of the deck as a hand and checking if they are a flush\n    #If the hand is a flush it is counted\n    flush=flush+chck_flush(deck[0:5])\n    \nprint(\"Probability of obtaining a flush=\", 100*(flush/10000),\"%\")\n\nProbability of obtaining a flush= 0.18 %"

    "text": "3.2 3.2 Using Pandas to Read CSVs\nPandas is a popular Python library used for working in tabular data (similar to the data stored in a spreadsheet). Pandas provides helper functions to read data from various file formats like CSV, Excel spreadsheets, HTML tables, JSON, SQL, and more.\nThe below format of storing data is known as comma-separated values or CSV. It contains day-wise Covid-19 data for Italy:\ndate,new_cases,new_deaths,new_tests\n2020-04-21,2256.0,454.0,28095.0\n2020-04-22,2729.0,534.0,44248.0\n2020-04-23,3370.0,437.0,37083.0\n2020-04-24,2646.0,464.0,95273.0\n2020-04-25,3021.0,420.0,38676.0\n2020-04-26,2357.0,415.0,24113.0\n2020-04-27,2324.0,260.0,26678.0\n2020-04-28,1739.0,333.0,37554.0\n...\n\nCSVs: A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields. (Wikipedia)\n\nFirst, let’s import the Pandas library. As a convention, it is imported with the alias pd.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\n\n\n3.2.1 3.2.1 Using the read_csv function\nThe pd.read_csv function can be used to read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame: a spreadsheet-like object for analyzing and processing data.\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings = pd.read_csv('../data/movie_ratings.csv')\n\n\nThe built-in python function type can be used to check the dataype of an object:\n\n\nCode\ntype(movie_ratings)\n\n\npandas.core.frame.DataFrame\n\n\nWe’ll learn more about DataFrame in a future lesson.\nNote that I use the relative path to specify the file path for movie_ratings.csv, you may need to change it based on where you store the data file.\n\n\n3.2.2 3.2.2 Data Overview\nOnce the data has been read, we may want to see what the data looks like. We’ll use another Pandas function head() to view the first few rows of the data.\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nUS Gross\nWorldwide Gross\nProduction Budget\nRelease Date\nMPAA Rating\nSource\nMajor Genre\nCreative Type\nIMDB Rating\nIMDB Votes\n\n\n\n\n0\nOpal Dreams\n14443\n14443\n9000000\nNov 22 2006\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nDrama\nFiction\n6.5\n468\n\n\n1\nMajor Dundee\n14873\n14873\n3800000\nApr 07 1965\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nWestern/Musical\nFiction\n6.7\n2588\n\n\n2\nThe Informers\n315000\n315000\n18000000\nApr 24 2009\nR\nAdapted screenplay\nHorror/Thriller\nFiction\n5.2\n7595\n\n\n3\nBuffalo Soldiers\n353743\n353743\n15000000\nJul 25 2003\nR\nAdapted screenplay\nComedy\nFiction\n6.9\n13510\n\n\n4\nThe Last Sin Eater\n388390\n388390\n2200000\nFeb 09 2007\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nDrama\nFiction\n5.7\n1012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow Indices and column names (axis labels)\nBy default, when you create a pandas DataFrame (or Series) without specifying an index, pandas will automatically assign integer-based row indices starting from 0. These indices serve as the row labels and uniquely identify each row in the DataFrame. For example, the index 2 correponds to the row of the movie The Informers. By default, the indices are integers starting from 0. However, they can be changed (to even non-integer values) if desired by the user.\nThe bold text on top of the DataFrame refers to column names. For example, the column US Gross consists of the gross revenue of a movie in the US.\nCollectively, the indices and column names are referred as axis labels.\nBasic information We can view some basic information about the data frame using the .info method.\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings.info()\n\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 2228 entries, 0 to 2227\nData columns (total 11 columns):\n #   Column             Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------             --------------  -----  \n 0   Title              2228 non-null   object \n 1   US Gross           2228 non-null   int64  \n 2   Worldwide Gross    2228 non-null   int64  \n 3   Production Budget  2228 non-null   int64  \n 4   Release Date       2228 non-null   object \n 5   MPAA Rating        2228 non-null   object \n 6   Source             2228 non-null   object \n 7   Major Genre        2228 non-null   object \n 8   Creative Type      2228 non-null   object \n 9   IMDB Rating        2228 non-null   float64\n 10  IMDB Votes         2228 non-null   int64  \ndtypes: float64(1), int64(4), object(6)\nmemory usage: 191.6+ KB\n\n\nThe shape property of a pandas DataFrame provides a tuple that represents the dimensions of the DataFrame:\n\nThe first value in the tuple is the number of rows.\nThe second value in the tuple is the number of columns.\n\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings.shape\n\n\n(2228, 11)\n\n\nThe columns property contains the list of columns within the data frame.\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings.columns\n\n\nIndex(['Title', 'US Gross', 'Worldwide Gross', 'Production Budget',\n       'Release Date', 'MPAA Rating', 'Source', 'Major Genre', 'Creative Type',\n       'IMDB Rating', 'IMDB Votes'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nYou can view statistical information for numerical columns (mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, and the number of non-empty values) using the .describe method.\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Gross\nWorldwide Gross\nProduction Budget\nIMDB Rating\nIMDB Votes\n\n\n\n\ncount\n2.228000e+03\n2.228000e+03\n2.228000e+03\n2228.000000\n2228.000000\n\n\nmean\n5.076370e+07\n1.019370e+08\n3.816055e+07\n6.239004\n33585.154847\n\n\nstd\n6.643081e+07\n1.648589e+08\n3.782604e+07\n1.243285\n47325.651561\n\n\nmin\n0.000000e+00\n8.840000e+02\n2.180000e+02\n1.400000\n18.000000\n\n\n25%\n9.646188e+06\n1.320737e+07\n1.200000e+07\n5.500000\n6659.250000\n\n\n50%\n2.838649e+07\n4.266892e+07\n2.600000e+07\n6.400000\n18169.000000\n\n\n75%\n6.453140e+07\n1.200000e+08\n5.300000e+07\n7.100000\n40092.750000\n\n\nmax\n7.601676e+08\n2.767891e+09\n3.000000e+08\n9.200000\n519541.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions & Methods we’ve looked so far\n\npd.read_csv - Read data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame object\n.info() - View basic infomation about rows, columns & data types\n.shape - Get the number of rows & columns as a tuple\n.columns - Get the list of column names\n.describe() - View statistical information about numeric columns"

The object data type is a catch-all for columns that contain mixed types or types that aren’t easily categorized.\n\n3.4.1 3.4.1 Available Data Types and Associated Built-in Functions\nIn a DataFrame, columns can have different data types. Here are the common data types you’ll encounter and some built-in functions associated with each type:\n\nNumerical Data (int, float)\n\nBuilt-in functions: mean(), sum(), min(), max(), std(), median(), quantile(), etc.\n\nObject Data (str or mixed types)\n\nBuilt-in functions: str.contains(), str.startswith(), str.endswith(), str.lower(), str.upper(), str.replace(), etc.\n\nDatetime Data (datetime64)\n\nBuilt-in functions: dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.strftime(), dt.weekday(), dt.hour, etc.\n\n\nThese functions help in exploring and transforming the data effectively depending on the type of data in each column.\n\n\n3.4.2 3.4.2 Data Type Conversion\nWhen you work on a specific column, being mindful of which data type it is, the data type depends on its built in function.\nOften, we need to convert the datatypes of some of the columns to make them suitable for analysis. For example, the datatype of Release Date in the DataFrame movie_ratings is object. To perform datetime related computations on this variable, we’ll need to convert it to a datatime format. We’ll use the Pandas function to_datatime() to covert it to a datatime format. Similar functions such as to_numeric(), to_string() etc., can be used for other conversions.\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings['Release Date']\n\n\n0       Nov 22 2006\n1       Apr 07 1965\n2       Apr 24 2009\n3       Jul 25 2003\n4       Feb 09 2007\n           ...     \n2223    Jul 07 2004\n2224    Jun 19 1998\n2225    May 14 2010\n2226    Jun 14 1991\n2227    Jan 23 1998\nName: Release Date, Length: 2228, dtype: object\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# check the datatype of release data column \nmovie_ratings['Release Date'].dtypes\n\n\ndtype('O')\n\n\nWe can see above that the function to_datetime() converts Release Date to a datetime format.\nNext, we’ll update the variable Release Date in the DataFrame to be in the datetime format:\n\n\nCode\nmovie_ratings['Release Date'] = pd.to_datetime(movie_ratings['Release Date'])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Let's check the datatype of release data column again\nmovie_ratings['Release Date'].dtypes\n\n\ndtype('&lt;M8[ns]')\n\n\ndtype('&lt;M8[ns]') means a 64-bit datetime object with nanosecond precision stored in little-endian format.

A couple of benefits of the JSON format are:\n\nSince the format is text only, JSON data can easily be exchanged between web applications, and used by any programming language.\nUnlike the csv format, JSON supports a hierarchical data structure, and is easier to integrate with APIs.\n\nThe JSON format can support a hierachical data structure, as it is built on the following two data structures (Source: technical documentation):\n\nA collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\nAn ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n\nThese are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.\nThe Pandas function read_json converts a JSON string to a Pandas DataFrame. The function dumps() of the json library converts a Python object to a JSON string.\nLets read the JSON data on Ted Talks.\n\n\nCode\ntedtalks_data = pd.read_json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwkenwaysun/TEDmap/master/data/TED_Talks.json')\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntedtalks_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nspeaker\nheadline\nURL\ndescription\ntranscript_URL\nmonth_filmed\nyear_filmed\nevent\nduration\ndate_published\ntags\nnewURL\ndate\nviews\nrates\n\n\n\n\n0\n7\nDavid Pogue\nSimplicity sells\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/7\nNew York Times columnist David Pogue takes aim...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/7/transcript?...\n2\n2006\nTED2006\n0:21:26\n6/27/06\nsimplicity,computers,software,interface design...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/david_pogue_says_sim...\n2006-06-27\n1646773\n[{'id': 7, 'name': 'Funny', 'count': 968}, {'i...\n\n\n1\n6\nCraig Venter\nSampling the ocean's DNA\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/6\nGenomics pioneer Craig Venter takes a break fr...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/6/transcript?...\n7\n2005\nTEDGlobal 2005\n0:16:51\n2004/05/07\nbiotech,invention,oceans,genetics,DNA,biology,...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_on_dna_...\n2004-05-07\n562625\n[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Courageous', 'count': 21},...\n\n\n2\n4\nBurt Rutan\nThe real future of space exploration\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/4\nIn this passionate talk, legendary spacecraft ...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/4/transcript?...\n2\n2006\nTED2006\n0:19:37\n10/25/06\naircraft,flight,industrial design,NASA,rocket ...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/burt_rutan_sees_the_...\n2006-10-25\n2046869\n[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Courageous', 'count': 169}...\n\n\n3\n3\nAshraf Ghani\nHow to rebuild a broken state\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/3\nAshraf Ghani's passionate and powerful 10-minu...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/3/transcript?...\n7\n2005\nTEDGlobal 2005\n0:18:45\n10/18/06\ncorruption,poverty,economics,investment,milita...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/ashraf_ghani_on_rebu...\n2006-10-18\n814554\n[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Courageous', 'count': 140}...\n\n\n4\n5\nChris Bangle\nGreat cars are great art\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/5\nAmerican designer Chris Bangle explains his ph...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/5/transcript?...\n2\n2002\nTED2002\n0:20:04\n2004/05/07\ncars,industrial design,transportation,inventio...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/chris_bangle_says_gr...\n2004-05-07\n870950\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Beautiful', 'count': 89}, ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[{'question': \"What is the data type of values in the last column (named 'rates') of the above dataset on ted talks\",\n  'type': 'multiple_choice',\n  'answers': [{'answer': 'list', 'correct': True, 'feedback': 'Correct!'},\n   {'answer': 'string',\n    'correct': False,\n    'feedback': 'Incorrect.

The data type of the elements in a NumPy array can be accessed using the .dtype attribute\n\n\nCode\nnumpy_array.dtype\n\n\ndtype('int64')\n\n\nNumPy supports a wide range of data types, each with a specific memory size. Here is a list of common NumPy data types and the memory they consume:\nNote that: these data type correspond directly to C data types, since NumPy uses C for the core computational operations. This C implementation allows NumPy to perform array operations much faster and more efficiently than native Python data structures.\n\n\n\nData Type\nMemory Size\n\n\n\n\nnp.int8\n1 byte\n\n\nnp.int16\n2 bytes\n\n\nnp.int32\n4 bytes\n\n\nnp.int64\n8 bytes\n\n\nnp.uint8\n1 byte\n\n\nnp.uint16\n2 bytes\n\n\nnp.uint32\n4 bytes\n\n\nnp.uint64\n8 bytes\n\n\nnp.float16\n2 bytes\n\n\nnp.float32\n4 bytes\n\n\nnp.float64\n8 bytes\n\n\nnp.complex64\n8 bytes\n\n\nnp.complex128\n16 bytes\n\n\nnp.bool_\n1 byte\n\n\nnp.string_\n1 byte per character\n\n\nnp.unicode_\n4 bytes per character\n\n\nnp.object_\nVariable\n\n\nnp.datetime64\n8 bytes\n\n\nnp.timedelta64\n8 bytes\n\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Upcasting\nWhen creating a NumPy array with elements of different data types, NumPy automatically attempts to upcast the elements to a compatible data type that can accommodate all of them. This process is known as type coercion or type promotion. The rules for upcasting follow a hierarchy of data types to ensure no data is lost.\nBelow are two common types of upcasting with examples:\nNumeric Upcasting: If you mix integers and floats, NumPy will convert the entire array to floats.\n\n\nCode\narr = np.array([1, 2.5, 3])\nprint(arr.dtype)  \n\n\nfloat64\n\n\nString Upcasting: If you mix numbers and strings, NumPy will upcast all elements to strings.\n\n\nCode\narr = np.array([1, 'hello', 3.5])\nprint(arr.dtype)\n\n\n&lt;U32\n\n\n&lt;U21 is a NumPy data type that stands for a Unicode string with a maximum length of 21 characters."

    "text": "6.4 Why do we need NumPy arrays?\nNumPy arrays can store data similarly to lists and tuples, and the same computations can be performed across these structures. However, NumPy is preferred because it is significantly more efficient, particularly when handling large datasets, due to its optimized memory usage and computational speed.\n\n6.4.1 Numpy arrays are memory efficient: Homogeneity and Contiguous Memory Storage\nA NumPy array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. In contrast, data structures like lists can hold elements of different data types, stored in non-contiguous memory locations. This homogeneity and contiguous storage allow NumPy arrays to be densely packed, leading to lower memory consumption. The following example demonstrates how NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient compared to other data structures.\n\n\nCode\nimport sys\n\n# Create a NumPy array, Python list, and tuple with the same elements\narray = np.arange(1000)\npy_list = list(range(1000))\npy_tuple = tuple(range(1000))\n\n# Calculate memory usage\narray_memory = array.nbytes\nlist_memory = sys.getsizeof(py_list) + sum(sys.getsizeof(item) for item in py_list)\ntuple_memory = sys.getsizeof(py_tuple) + sum(sys.getsizeof(item) for item in py_tuple)\n\n# Display the memory usage\nmemory_usage = {\n    \"NumPy Array (in bytes)\": array_memory,\n    \"Python List (in bytes)\": list_memory,\n    \"Python Tuple (in bytes)\": tuple_memory\n}\n\nmemory_usage\n\n\n{'NumPy Array (in bytes)': 8000,\n 'Python List (in bytes)': 36056,\n 'Python Tuple (in bytes)': 36040}\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# each element in the array is a 64-bit integer\narray.dtype\n\n\ndtype('int64')\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2 NumPy arrays are fast\nWith NumPy arrays, mathematical computations can be performed faster, as compared to other data structures, due to the following reasons:\n\nAs the NumPy array is densely packed with homogenous data, it helps retrieve the data faster as well, thereby making computations faster.\nWith NumPy, vectorized computations can replace the relatively more expensive python for loops. The NumPy package breaks down the vectorized computations into multiple fragments and then processes all the fragments parallelly. However, with a for loop, computations will be one at a time.\nThe NumPy package integrates C, and C++ codes in Python. These programming languages have very little execution time as compared to Python.\n\nWe’ll see the faster speed on NumPy computations in the example below.\nExample: This example shows that computations using NumPy arrays are typically much faster than computations with other data structures.\nQ: Multiply whole numbers up to 1 million by an integer, say 2. Compare the time taken for the computation if the numbers are stored in a NumPy array vs a list.\nUse the numpy function arange() to define a one-dimensional NumPy array.\n\n\nCode\n#Examples showing NumPy arrays are more efficient for numerical computation\nimport time as tm\n\n# List comprehension to multiply each element by 2\nstart_time = tm.time()\nlist_ex = list(range(1000000))  # List containing whole numbers up to 1 million\na = [x * 2 for x in list_ex]    # Multiply each element by 2\nprint(\"Time taken to multiply numbers in a list = \", tm.time() - start_time)\n\n# Tuple - converting to list for multiplication, then back to tuple\nstart_time = tm.time()\ntuple_ex = tuple(range(1000000))  # Tuple containing whole numbers up to 1 million\na = tuple(x * 2 for x in tuple_ex)  # Multiply each element by 2\nprint(\"Time taken to multiply numbers in a tuple = \", tm.time() - start_time)\n\n# NumPy array element-wise multiplication\nstart_time = tm.time()\nnumpy_ex = np.arange(1000000)  # NumPy array containing whole numbers up to 1 million\na = numpy_ex * 2               # Multiply each element by 2\nprint(\"Time taken to multiply numbers in a NumPy array = \", tm.time() - start_time)\n\n\nTime taken to multiply numbers in a list =  0.049832820892333984\nTime taken to multiply numbers in a tuple =  0.08172726631164551\nTime taken to multiply numbers in a NumPy array =  0.010966300964355469"

    "text": "6.8 Array Reshaping\nCertain functions and machine learning models require input data in a specific shape or format. For instance, operations like matrix multiplication and broadcasting depend on the alignment of array dimensions. Many deep learning models expect input data to be in a 4D array format (batch size, height, width, channels). Reshaping enables us to convert data into the necessary shape, ensuring compatibility without altering the underlying values.\nBelow are some methods to reshape NumPy arrays:\n\n6.8.1 reshape()\nThe reshape method in NumPy allows you to change the shape of an existing array without changing its data.\n\n\nCode\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\nreshaped_arr = arr.reshape(2, 3)\nprint(reshaped_arr)\n\n\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]]\n\n\nUsing-1 for automatic dimension inference\n\n\nCode\narr = np.arange(12)\nreshaped_arr = arr.reshape(3, -1)\nprint(reshaped_arr)\n\n\n[[ 0  1  2  3]\n [ 4  5  6  7]\n [ 8  9 10 11]]\n\n\nHere, -1 means “calculate this dimension based on the remaining dimensions and the total size of the array”. So, (3, -1) becomes (3, 4).\n\n\n6.8.2 flatten() and ravel()\nThe flatten method returns a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension. It is useful when you need to perform operations that require 1D input or need to pass the array data as a linear sequence. order specifies the order in which elements are read, options include but not limited to: * C (default): Row-major (C-style). * F: Column-major (Fortran-style).\nIn contrast, ravel() returns a flattened view of the original array whenever possible, without creating a copy.\n\n\nCode\narr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nflattened_arr = arr.flatten()\nprint(flattened_arr)\n\n\n[1 2 3 4 5 6]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# using ravel() to flatten the array\nflattened_arr = arr.ravel()\nprint(flattened_arr)\n\n\n[1 2 3 4 5 6]\n\n\n\n\n6.8.3 resize()\nChanges the shape and size of an array in place. Unlike reshape(), it can modify the array and fill additional elements with zeros if necessary.\n\n\nCode\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\narr.resize(2, 3) \nprint(arr)\n\n\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 0 0]]\n\n\n\n\n6.8.4 tranpose() or T\nBoth can be used to transpose the NumPy array. This is often used to make matrices (2-dimensional arrays) compatible for multiplication.\n\n\nCode\narr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\ntransposed_arr = arr.transpose()  # Output: [[1 4], [2 5], [3 6]]\nprint(transposed_arr)\n\nT_arr = arr.T  # Output: [[1 4], [2 5], [3 6]]\nprint(T_arr)\n\n\n[[1 4]\n [2 5]\n [3 6]]\n[[1 4]\n [2 5]\n [3 6]]"

    "text": "6.9 Arrays Concaternating\nNumPy provides several functions to concatenate arrays along different axes.\n\n6.9.1 np.concatenate()\nArrays can be concatenated along an axis with NumPy’s concatenate function. The axis argument specifies the dimension for concatenation. The arrays should have the same number of dimensions, and the same length along each axis except the axis used for concatenation.\nThe examples below show concatenation of arrays.\n\n\nCode\narr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]])\narr2 = np.array([[2, 2, 3], [1, 2, 5]])\nprint(\"Array 1:\\n\",arr1)\nprint(\"Array 2:\\n\",arr2)\n\n\nArray 1:\n [[1 2 3]\n [3 4 5]]\nArray 2:\n [[2 2 3]\n [1 2 5]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Concatenating the arrays along the default axis: axis=0\nnp.concatenate((arr1,arr2))\n\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [3, 4, 5],\n       [2, 2, 3],\n       [1, 2, 5]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Concatenating the arrays along axis = 1\nnp.concatenate((arr1,arr2),axis=1)\n\n\narray([[1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3],\n       [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5]])\n\n\nHere’s a visual explanation of np.concatenate along axis=1 (can you guess what axis=0 results in?):\n\nLet us concatenate the array below (arr3) with arr1, along axis = 0.\n\n\nCode\narr3 = np.array([2, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnp.concatenate((arr1,arr3),axis=0)\n\n\nValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)\n\n\nNote the above error, which indicates that arr3 has only one dimension.

    "text": "6.10 Vectorization in NumPy\n\n6.10.1 Introduction to Vectorization\nVectorization is the process of applying operations to entire arrays or matrices simultaneously rather than iterating over individual elements using loops. This approach allows NumPy to utilize highly optimized C libraries for faster computation.\n\nBenefits of Vectorization:\n\nPerformance: Significantly faster than using for-loops in Python.\nConciseness: Shorter and more readable code.\nEfficiency: Reduces the overhead of Python loops and leverages lower-level optimizations.\n\n\n\n6.10.2 Understanding Vectorized Operations with Examples\n\n\nCode\n# Create two arrays\narr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\narr2 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n\n# Element-wise addition (vectorized operation)\nsum_arr = arr1 + arr2\nprint(\"Sum Array:\", sum_arr)\n\n\nSum Array: [11 22 33 44 55]\n\n\n\n\n6.10.3 NumPy Vectorization Vs Python for Loop\nnp.dot is a vectorized operation in NumPy that performs matrix multiplication or dot product between arrays. It efficiently computes the element-wise multiplications and then sums them up. To better understand its efficiency, let’s first implement the dot product using for loops, and then compare its performance with np.dot to see the benefits of vectorization.\n\n\nCode\nimport time\n\n# Function to calculate dot product using for loops\ndef dot_product_loops(arr1, arr2):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr1)):\n        result += arr1[i] * arr2[i]\n    return result\n\n# Create sample arrays\narr1 = np.random.rand(1000000)\narr2 = np.random.rand(1000000)\n\n# Measure time for the loop-based implementation\nstart_time = time.time()\nloop_result = dot_product_loops(arr1, arr2)\nloop_time = time.time() - start_time\n\n# Measure time for np.dot\nstart_time = time.time()\nnumpy_result = np.dot(arr1, arr2)\nnumpy_time = time.time() - start_time\n\n# Display results\nprint(f\"Loop-based implementation result: {loop_result:.5f}, Time: {loop_time:.5f} seconds\")\nprint(f\"NumPy np.dot result: {numpy_result:.5f}, Time: {numpy_time:.5f} seconds\")\n\n\nLoop-based implementation result: 250068.46992, Time: 0.19136 seconds\nNumPy np.dot result: 250068.46992, Time: 0.00199 seconds\n\n\nThe np.dot function significantly outperforms the manual loop-based implementation because it leverages NumPy’s vectorized operations, which is written in highly efficient C code. This example highlights why vectorized operations like np.dot are preferred for large-scale numerical computations in NumPy.\n\n\n6.10.4 Broadcasting and Its Role in Vectorization\nBroadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations between arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding their dimensions. This is essential for vectorized operations involving arrays with varying shapes.\nLet’s look at an example to see how it works\n\n\nCode\narr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], \n                 [5, 6, 7, 8], \n                 [9, 1, 2, 3]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\narr4 = np.array([4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\n\n\nCode\narr2 + arr4\n\n\narray([[ 5,  7,  9, 11],\n       [ 9, 11, 13, 15],\n       [13,  6,  8, 10]])\n\n\nWhen the expression arr2 + arr4 is evaluated, arr4 (which has the shape (4,)) is replicated three times to match the shape (3, 4) of arr2. Numpy performs the replication without actually creating three copies of the smaller dimension array, thus improving performance and using lower memory.\n\nBroadcasting only works if one of the arrays can be replicated to match the other array’s shape.\n\nDimensions of size 1 will broadcast (as if the value was repeated).\nOtherwise, the dimension must have the same shape.\n\n\n\nCode\narr5 = np.array([7, 8])\n\n\n\n\nCode\narr2 + arr5\n\n\nValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,4) (2,) \n\n\nIn the above example, even if arr5 is replicated three times, it will not match the shape of arr2. Hence arr2 + arr5 cannot be evaluated successfully. See the broadcasting documentation to learn more about it.\n\n\n6.10.5 Matrix Multiplication in NumPy with Vectorization\nMatrix multiplication is one of the most common and computationally intensive operations in numerical computing and deep learning. NumPy offers efficient and highly optimized methods for performing matrix multiplication, which leverage vectorization to handle large matrices quickly and accurately.\nNote that: NumPy matrix operations follow the standard rules of linear algebra, so it’s important to ensure that the shapes of the matrices are compatible. If they are not, consider reshaping the matrices before performing multiplication\nThere are two commonly methods for matrix multiplication\n\n6.10.5.1 Method 1: Matrix Multiplication Using np.dot()\n\n\nCode\n# Define two 2D arrays (matrices)\nmatrix1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], \n                    [4, 5, 6]])\nmatrix2 = np.array([[7, 8], \n                    [9, 10], \n                    [11, 12]])\n\n# Matrix multiplication using np.dot\nresult_dot = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)\nprint(\"Matrix Multiplication using np.dot:\\n\", result_dot)\n\n# Another way to perform np.dot for matrix multiplication\nresult_dot2 = matrix1.dot(matrix2)\nprint(\"\\nMatrix Multiplication using dot method:\\n\", result_dot2)\n\n\nMatrix Multiplication using np.dot:\n [[ 58  64]\n [139 154]]\n\nMatrix Multiplication using dot method:\n [[ 58  64]\n [139 154]]\n\n\n\n\n6.10.5.2 Method 2: Matrix Multiplication using np.matmul() pr @\n\n\nCode\n# Matrix multiplication using np.matmul or @ operator\nresult_matmul = np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)\nresult_operator = matrix1 @ matrix2\nprint(\"\\nMatrix Multiplication using np.matmul:\\n\", result_matmul)\nprint(\"\\nMatrix Multiplication using @ operator:\\n\", result_operator)\n\n\n\nMatrix Multiplication using np.matmul:\n [[ 58  64]\n [139 154]]\n\nMatrix Multiplication using @ operator:\n [[ 58  64]\n [139 154]]\n\n\nNote that * operator in numpy is element-wise multiplication\n\n\nCode\n# using * operator for element-wise multiplication\nelement_wise = matrix1 * matrix2\nprint(\"\\nElement-wise Multiplication:\\n\", element_wise)\n\n\nValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (2,3) (3,2) \n\n\n\n\nCode\n# reshape the array for element-wise multiplication\nmatrix2_reshaped = matrix2.reshape(2, 3)\nelement_wise = matrix1 * matrix2_reshaped\nprint(\"\\nElement-wise Multiplication after reshaping:\\n\", element_wise)\n\n\n\nElement-wise Multiplication after reshaping:\n [[ 7 16 27]\n [40 55 72]]"

Find out which shop should each person go to minimize their expenses.\n\n\nCode\n#Reading the datasets on food quantity and price\nimport pandas as pd\nfood_qty = pd.read_csv('../data/food_quantity.csv',index_col=0)\nprice = pd.read_csv('../data/price.csv',index_col=0)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfood_qty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroll\nbun\ncake\nbread\n\n\nPerson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen\n6\n5\n3\n1\n\n\nBarbara\n3\n6\n2\n2\n\n\nBeth\n3\n4\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nKroger\n\n\nItem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroll\n1.5\n1.0\n\n\nbun\n2.0\n2.5\n\n\ncake\n5.0\n4.5\n\n\nbread\n16.0\n17.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s start from a simple problem. We’ll compute the expenses of Ben if he prefers to buy all food items from Target\n\n\nCode\n%%time\n# write a for loop to calculate the total cost of Ben's food if he shops at the Target store\ntotal_cost = 0 \nfor food in food_qty.columns:\n\n    total_cost += food_qty.loc['Ben',food]*price.loc[food,'Target']\ntotal_cost\n\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 0 ns\n\n\nnp.float64(50.0)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n%%time\n# using numpy \ntotal_cost = np.sum(food_qty.loc['Ben',]*price.loc[:,'Target'])\ntotal_cost\n\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 1 ms\n\n\nnp.float64(50.0)\n\n\nBen will spend $50 if he goes to Target\nNow, let’s add another layer of complication. We’ll compute Ben’s expenses for both stores - Target and Kroger\n\n\nCode\n%%time\n# using loops to calculate the total cost of food for Ben for all stores\ntotal_cost = {}\nfor store in price.columns:\n    total_cost[store] = 0\n    for food in food_qty.columns:\n        total_cost[store] += food_qty.loc['Ben',food]*price.loc[food,store]\ntotal_cost\n\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 1 ms\n\n\n{'Target': np.float64(50.0), 'Kroger': np.float64(49.0)}\n\n\n\n\nCode\n%%time\n# using numpy\ntotal_cost = np.dot(food_qty.loc['Ben',],price.loc[:,:])\ntotal_cost\n\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 0 ns\n\n\narray([50., 49.])\n\n\nBen will spend $50 if he goes to Target, and $49 if he goes to Kroger. Thus, he should choose Kroger.\nNow, let’s add the final layer of complication, and solve the problem. We’ll compute everyone’s expenses for both stores - Target and Kroger\n\n\nCode\n%%timeit\nstore_expense = pd.DataFrame(0.0, columns=price.columns, index = food_qty.index)\nfor person in store_expense.index:\n    for store in store_expense.columns:\n        for food in food_qty.columns:\n            store_expense.loc[person, store] += food_qty.loc[person, food]*price.loc[food, store]\n\nstore_expense\n\n\n1.51 ms ± 15.3 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n%%timeit\n# using matrix multiplication in numpy\npd.DataFrame(np.dot(food_qty.values, price.values), columns=price.columns, index=food_qty.index)\n\n\n11 μs ± 102 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)\n\n\nBased on the above table, Ben should go to Kroger, Barbara to Target and Beth can go to either store.\nAs the complexity of operations increases, the number of nested for-loops also grows, making the code more cumbersome and harder to manage. In contrast, the approach using NumPy arrays remains concise and straightforward, regardless of complexity. Vectorized computations are not only cleaner but also significantly faster, providing a more efficient solution.\n\n\n\n6.11.2 Practice 3\nUse matrix multiplication to find the average IMDB rating and average Rotten tomatoes rating for each genre - comedy, action, drama and horror.

    "text": "3.4 Setting Up Python Development Environment in VS Code using python venv\nUnlike Spyder and PyCharm, which are specifically designed for Python development, VS Code is a versatile code editor with multi-language support. As a result, setting up the Python environment requires some additional configuration.\nThis step-by-step guide will walk you through setting up your Python environment in Visual Studio Code from scratch using venv.\n\n3.4.1 Install Python\n\nDownload Python:\n\nGo to the official Python website and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.\nEnsure that you check the box “Add Python to PATH” during installation.\n\nVerify Python Installation:\n\nOpen a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:\npython --version\nYou should see the installed Python version.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Install Visual Studio Code Extensions\n\nOpen VS Code.\nGo to Extensions:\n\nClick on the Extensions icon on the sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X.\n\nInstall Python Extension:\n\nSearch for the “Python” extension by Microsoft and install it.\n\nInstall Jupyter Extension:\n\nSearch for the “Jupyter” extension by Microsoft and install it.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Set Up a Python Workspace for this course\n\nCreate a New Folder:\n\nCreate a new folder on your computer where you want to store your Python code for this course.\n\nOpen Folder in VS Code:\n\nGo to File &gt; Open Folder and select the newly created folder.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Create a Notebook for your work\n\nIn VS Code, go to File &gt; New File and select Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Create a Python environment for your work - GUI method\n\nWhen you start a Jupyter Notebook in VS Code, you need to choose a kernel. Kernel is the “engine” that runs your code within your Jupyter notebook, and it is tied to a specific Python interpreter or environment.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an interpreter and an environment? An interpreter is a program that runs your Python code. An environment, on the other hand, is a standalone “space” where your code runs. It’s like a container that holds its own interpreter and environment-specific libraries/dependencies, so each project can have its own environment setup without affecting others.\nWhy do we prefer creating an environment for this course rather than using the global interpreter that comes with your Python installation? As a data scientist, you may work on multiple projects and attend different courses that require different sets of packages, dependencies, or even Python versions. By creating a separate environment, you can prevent conflicts between libraries, dependencies, and Python versions across your projects (dependency hell) and also ensure code reproducibility. It is always good practice to work within python environments, especially when you have different projects going on.\nLet’s create a Python environment for the upcoming coursework.\n\n\n\n\nAlt Text\n\n\nCreate using venv in the current workspace\n:\nKey Differences between venv and conda\n\nEcosystem:\n\n\nvenv is specifically for Python and is part of the standard library.\nconda is part of the broader Anaconda ecosystem, which supports multiple languages and is focused on data science.\n\n\nPackage Management:\n\n\nvenv relies on pip for package management.\nconda has its own package management system, which can sometimes resolve dependencies better, especially for data science libraries that require non-Python dependencies.\n\n. Environment Creation:\n\nvenv creates lightweight virtual environments tied to a specific version of Python.\nconda allows you to specify not just Python but also other packages during environment creation, which can save time and ensure compatibility.\n\n\nCross-Platform:\n\n\nBoth tools are cross-platform, but conda is often favored in data science for its ability to manage complex dependencies.\n\nHow to choose\n\nUse venv for lightweight, Python-only projects where you want a simple way to manage dependencies. We are going with venv for our course.\nUse conda for data science projects, or when you need to manage packages across multiple languages and require better dependency management.\n\nChoose python interpreter for your environment:\n\n\n\nAlt Text\n\n\n\nCongratulations! A virtual environment named .venv has been successfully created in your project folder.\n\n\n3.4.6 Create a Python environment for your work - Command Line Method\nInstead of using the VSCode GUI, we can also create a venv environment with command line commands.\n\nCreate a Virtual Environment:\n\nOpen the terminal in VS Code and run:\npython -m venv venv\nThis creates a virtual environment named venv in your project folder.\n\nActivate the Virtual Environment:\n\nWindows:\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\nmacOS/Linux:\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n\n\n\n3.4.7 Choose the .venv environment as the kernel to run the notebook\nFor all your upcoming work in this project, you can select this environment to ensure a consistent setup.\n\n\n3.4.8 Installing ipykernel for your notebook\nCreate a code cell in the notebook and run it. The first time you run a code cell, you will run into\n - After installing ipykernel, you should be able to run the following cell.\n\n\nCode\nimport sys\nprint(\"Current Python executable:\", sys.executable)\n\n\nCurrent Python executable: c:\\Users\\lsi8012\\OneDrive - Northwestern University\\FA24\\303-1\\test_env\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe\n\n\nsys.executable is an attribute in the Python sys module that returns the path to the Python interpreter that is currently executing your code.\nHowever, none of the data science packages are installed in the environment by default. To perform your data science tasks, you’ll need to import some commonly used Python libraries for Data Science, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. While Anaconda typically has these libraries installed automatically, in VS Code, you’ll need to install them for your specific environment. If you don’t, you may encounter errors when trying to use these libraries.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nummpy'\n\n\n\n\n3.4.9 Install Data Science packages within the created Environment\nPackages are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionality such as scientific computing, linear algegra, visualization, or machine learning models without having to write everything from scratch. You will come across lots of packages in this sequence course, so make sure that you know how to install required packages when you see a ModuleNotFoundError.\nYou have two primary ways to install DS packages:\n\nInstalling from the Terminal\nInstalling from the Notebook\n\n\n3.4.9.1 Installing from the terminal\n\nOpen a New Terminal: Check the terminal prompt to see if the active environment is consistent with the kernel you’ve chosen for your notebook.\n\nIf you see (.venv) at the beginning of the prompt, it means the virtual environment .venv is active and matches the notebook kernel.\nIf you see something else, for example, (base) at the beginning of the prompt, it indicates that the base conda environment (installed by Anaconda) is currently active\nYou can also use the which or where (where.exe in windows) command: On macOS/Linux, use: which python ; On windows, use: where.exe python\n\n\n\nNote that when you have both Anaconda and VS Code installed on your system, sometimes the environments can conflict with each other. If the terminal environment is inconsistent with the notebook kernel, packages may be installed in a different environment than intended. This can lead to issues where the notebook cannot access the installed packages.\n\n\nUsing pip (if you create a venv environment)\n\npip install numpy pandas matplotlib\n\n\n3.4.9.2 Installing from the Notebook\nYou can also install packages directly from a Jupyter Notebook cell using a magic command. This is often convenient because it allows you to install packages without leaving the notebook interface.\n\n\nCode\npip install numpy pandas matplotlib\n\n\nLet’s rerun this code cell and see whether the error is addressed\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nKey takeaway\nBoth methods are valid, and the choice depends on your preference and workflow. Installing from the terminal is common for batch installations or when setting up a new environment, while installing from the notebook can be handy for quick additions during your data analysis work.\n\n\n\n3.4.10 Create a requirement.txt to back up your environment or share with your collaborator\npip freeze outputs the packages and their versions installed in the current environment in a format that can be used as requirements.txt, which allows you to easily recreate the environment or share it with others for consistent setups.\n\n\nCode\npip freeze\n\n\nasttokens==2.4.1\ncolorama==0.4.6\ncomm==0.2.2\ncontourpy==1.3.0\ncycler==0.12.1\ndebugpy==1.8.6\ndecorator==5.1.1\nexecuting==2.1.0\nfonttools==4.54.1\nipykernel==6.29.5\nipython==8.27.0\njedi==0.19.1\njupyter_client==8.6.3\njupyter_core==5.7.2\nkiwisolver==1.4.7\nmatplotlib==3.9.2\nmatplotlib-inline==0.1.7\nnest-asyncio==1.6.0\nnumpy==2.1.1\npackaging==24.1\npandas==2.2.3\nparso==0.8.4\npillow==10.4.0\nplatformdirs==4.3.6\nprompt_toolkit==3.0.48\npsutil==6.0.0\npure_eval==0.2.3\nPygments==2.18.0\npyparsing==3.1.4\npython-dateutil==2.9.0.post0\npytz==2024.2\npywin32==306\npyzmq==26.2.0\nsix==1.16.0\nstack-data==0.6.3\ntornado==6.4.1\ntraitlets==5.14.3\ntzdata==2024.2\nwcwidth==0.2.13\nNote: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n\n\nUsing the redirection operator &gt;, you can save the output of pip freeze to a requirement.txt.

There are two types of magic commands: - Line magics: Commands that operate on a single line. - Cell magics: Commands that operate on the entire cell.\nIn Jupyter notebooks, line magic commands are invoked by placing a single percentage sign (%) in front of the statement, allowing for quick, inline operations, while cell magic commands are denoted with double percentage signs (%%) at the beginning of the cell, enabling you to apply commands to the entire cell for more complex tasks.\nYou can access the full list of magic commands by typing:\n%lsmagic\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# show all the avaiable magic commands on the system\n%lsmagic\n\nAvailable line magics:\n%alias  %alias_magic  %autoawait  %autocall  %automagic  %autosave  %bookmark  %cd  %clear  %cls  %code_wrap  %colors  %conda  %config  %connect_info  %copy  %ddir  %debug  %dhist  %dirs  %doctest_mode  %echo  %ed  %edit  %env  %gui  %hist  %history  %killbgscripts  %ldir  %less  %load  %load_ext  %loadpy  %logoff  %logon  %logstart  %logstate  %logstop  %ls  %lsmagic  %macro  %magic  %mamba  %matplotlib  %micromamba  %mkdir  %more  %notebook  %page  %pastebin  %pdb  %pdef  %pdoc  %pfile  %pinfo  %pinfo2  %pip  %popd  %pprint  %precision  %prun  %psearch  %psource  %pushd  %pwd  %pycat  %pylab  %qtconsole  %quickref  %recall  %rehashx  %reload_ext  %ren  %rep  %rerun  %reset  %reset_selective  %rmdir  %run  %save  %sc  %set_env  %store  %sx  %system  %tb  %time  %timeit  %unalias  %unload_ext  %who  %who_ls  %whos  %xdel  %xmode\n\nAvailable cell magics:\n%%!  %%HTML  %%SVG  %%bash  %%capture  %%cmd  %%code_wrap  %%debug  %%file  %%html  %%javascript  %%js  %%latex  %%markdown  %%perl  %%prun  %%pypy  %%python  %%python2  %%python3  %%ruby  %%script  %%sh  %%svg  %%sx  %%system  %%time  %%timeit  %%writefile\n\nAutomagic is ON, % prefix IS NOT needed for line magics.\n\n:::\n\n\n4.1.2 Line Magic Commands\n\n4.1.2.1 %time: Timing the execution of code\nIn data science, it is often crucial to evaluate the performance of specific code snippets or algorithms, and the %time magic command provides a simple and efficient way to measure the execution time of individual statements, helping you identify bottlenecks and optimize your code for better performance.\n\n\nCode\ndef my_dot(a, b): \n    \"\"\"\n   Compute the dot product of two vectors\n \n    Args:\n      a (ndarray (n,)):  input vector \n      b (ndarray (n,)):  input vector with same dimension as a\n    \n    Returns:\n      x (scalar): \n    \"\"\"\n    x=0\n    for i in range(a.shape[0]):\n        x = x + a[i] * b[i]\n    return x\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(1)\na = np.random.rand(10000000)  # very large arrays\nb = np.random.rand(10000000)\n\n\nLet’s use %time to measure the execution time of a single line of code.\n\n\nCode\n# Example: Timing a list comprehension\n%time np.dot(a, b)\n# \n\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 4.78 ms\n\n\n2501072.5816813153\n\n\n\n\nCode\n%time my_dot(a, b)\n\n\nCPU times: total: 1.88 s\nWall time: 1.86 s\n\n\n2501072.5816813707\n\n\nTo capture the output of %time (or %timeit), you cannot directly assign it to a variable as it’s a magic command that prints the result to the notebook’s output. However, you can use Python’s built-in time module to manually time your code and assign the execution time to a variable.\nHere’s how you can do it using the time module:\n\n\nCode\nimport time\ntic = time.time()  # capture start time\nc = np.dot(a, b)\ntoc = time.time()  # capture end time\n\nprint(f\"np.dot(a, b) =  {c:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Vectorized version duration: {1000*(toc-tic):.4f} ms \")\n\ntic = time.time()  # capture start time\nc = my_dot(a,b)\ntoc = time.time()  # capture end time\n\nprint(f\"my_dot(a, b) =  {c:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"loop version duration: {1000*(toc-tic):.4f} ms \")\n\ndel(a);del(b)  #remove these big arrays from memory\n\n\nnp.dot(a, b) =  2501072.5817\nVectorized version duration: 0.0000 ms \nmy_dot(a, b) =  2501072.5817\nloop version duration: 2228.7092 ms \n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.2 %who and %whos: Listing variables\n\n%who: Lists all variables in the current namespace.\n%whos: Lists variables along with their types, sizes, and values\n\n\n\nCode\n# Example: Checking variables in memory\na = 10\nb = \"data science\"\n%who\n%whos \n\n\nA    B   C   a   b   c   current_dir     file_path   my_dot  \nnp   os  plt     sys     tic     time    toc     x   y   \n\nVariable      Type        Data/Info\n-----------------------------------\nA             ndarray     1000x1000: 1000000 elems, type `float64`, 8000000 bytes (7.62939453125 Mb)\nB             ndarray     1000x1000: 1000000 elems, type `float64`, 8000000 bytes (7.62939453125 Mb)\nC             ndarray     1000x1000: 1000000 elems, type `float64`, 8000000 bytes (7.62939453125 Mb)\na             int         10\nb             str         data science\nc             float64     2501072.5816813707\ncurrent_dir   str         c:\\Users\\lsi8012\\OneDrive&lt;...&gt;iversity\\FA24\\303-1\\Week2\nfile_path     str         C:Users\\Username\\Documents\\data.csv\nmy_dot        function    &lt;function my_dot at 0x00000267B1EFBCE0&gt;\nnp            module      &lt;module 'numpy' from 'c:\\&lt;...&gt;ges\\\\numpy\\\\__init__.py'&gt;\nos            module      &lt;module 'os' (frozen)&gt;\nplt           module      &lt;module 'matplotlib.pyplo&lt;...&gt;\\\\matplotlib\\\\pyplot.py'&gt;\nsys           module      &lt;module 'sys' (built-in)&gt;\ntic           float       1727812577.7224722\ntime          module      &lt;module 'time' (built-in)&gt;\ntoc           float       1727812579.9511814\nx             ndarray     100: 100 elems, type `float64`, 800 bytes\ny             ndarray     100: 100 elems, type `float64`, 800 bytes\n\n\nBoth %who and %whos will list all variables, including those defined in the notebook’s code cells.

You can execute them directly within Jupyter by prefixing the command with an exclamation mark (!). In a Jupyter notebook, while the IPython kernel executes the Python code, it delegates the shell commands to the operating system’s shell. They are not executed by the same engine. The IPython kernel is for Python code, while the shell commands are handled by underlying operating system shell (e.g., Bash on macOS/Linux, or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows).\n\n4.2.1 Using Shell Commands\n\n4.2.1.1 !pwd(!cd in windows): Print working directory\nYou can check current working directory with the !pwd(!cd in windows) command.\n\n\nCode\n!cd\n\n\nc:\\Users\\lsi8012\\OneDrive - Northwestern University\\FA24\\303-1\\Week2\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.2 !ls(!dir in windows): Listing files and directories\nList the contents of the current directory.\n\n\nCode\n!dir\n\n\n Volume in drive C is Windows\n Volume Serial Number is A80C-7DEC\n\n Directory of c:\\Users\\lsi8012\\OneDrive - Northwestern University\\FA24\\303-1\\Week2\n\n10/01/2024  12:37 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          .\n10/01/2024  12:37 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..\n09/30/2024  04:49 PM         1,088,640 Environments.pptx\n09/29/2024  02:19 PM           985,591 env_setup.html\n09/29/2024  01:18 PM             5,289 Exercise1_Environment.ipynb\n09/29/2024  03:23 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          images\n10/01/2024  12:44 PM            46,267 magic_shell_path_specification.ipynb\n09/16/2024  02:25 PM            72,461 python-os-and-filesystem.ipynb\n10/01/2024  12:38 PM                82 sample.txt\n09/29/2024  03:20 PM           783,205 Setup_env.pdf\n09/29/2024  02:19 PM            36,228 venv_setup.ipynb\n               8 File(s)      3,017,763 bytes\n               3 Dir(s)  153,680,662,528 bytes free\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 !mkdir: Creating a new directory\nYou can create a new directory using the !mkdir command.\n\n\nCode\n!mkdir new_folder\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.4 !cat(type in windows): Displaying file content\nUse !cat(type in windows) to display the contents of a file.\n\n\nCode\n!type sample.txt\n\n\nThis is an example of writing content to a file using %%writefile magic command."

    "text": "4.4 4. File Path in Data Science\nNext, we will discuss how to specify file paths in Python for loading and saving data, with an emphasis on absolute and relative paths. File paths are crucial when working with files in Python, such as reading datasets and writing results to files. Let’s explore the difference between absolute paths and relative paths.\n\n4.4.0.1 4.1. Absolute Path\nAn absolute path provides the complete location of a file or directory from the root directory of your file system. It is independent of the current working directory.\n\n\n4.4.0.2 Example of an Absolute Path (Windows):\n# Absolute path example (Windows)\nfile_path = r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\data.csv\"\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n!conda env list\n\n# conda environments:\n#\nbase                  *  C:\\Users\\lsi8012\\AppData\\Local\\anaconda3\n                         c:\\Users\\lsi8012\\Documents\\Courses\\STAT303-Fa24\\stat303_conda\\.conda\n\n\n:::\nThe path associated with each conda env is absolute path.\n\n\n4.4.0.3 4.2. Relative Path\nA relative path specifies the file location in relation to the current working directory. It is shorter and more flexible since it doesn’t require the full path from the root.\nTo find the current working directory in Python, you can use either a magic command or a shell command, as shown below:\n\n\nCode\n# Magic command\n%pwd\n\n\n'c:\\\\Users\\\\lsi8012\\\\OneDrive - Northwestern University\\\\FA24\\\\303-1\\\\Week2'\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Shell command\n!cd\n\n\nc:\\Users\\lsi8012\\OneDrive - Northwestern University\\FA24\\303-1\\Week2\n\n\nExample of a Relative Path:\n\n\nCode\n# Example of relative path\nfile_path = \"sample.txt\"  # Relative to the current directory\n\n\nThe relative path sample.txt means that there is a file in the current working directory.\n\n\n4.4.0.4 4.3. Methods to Specify file path in Windows\nWindows uses backslashes (\\) to separate directories in file paths. However, in Python, the backslash is an escape character, so you need to either: * Escape backslashes by using a double backslash (\\\\), or * Use raw strings by prefixing the path with r.\n\n4.4.0.4.1 Method 1: Using escaped backslashes\n\n\nCode\nfile_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Username\\\\Documents\\\\data.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n4.4.0.4.2 Method 2: Using Raw Strings\n\n\nCode\nfile_path = r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\data.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n4.4.0.4.3 Method 3: Using forward slashes (/)\n\n\nCode\nfile_path = \"C:/Users/Username/Documents/data.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n4.4.0.4.4 Method 4: Using os.path.join\n\n\nCode\nimport os\nfile_path = os.path.join(\"C:\", \"Users\", \"Username\", \"Documents\", \"data.csv\")\n\n\nThis method works across different operating systems because os.path.join automatically uses the correct path separator (\\ for Windows and /for Linux/Mac).\nmacOS does not have the same issue as Windows when specifying file paths because macOS (like Linux) uses forward slashes (/) as the path separator, which is consistent with Python’s expectations.\n\n\n\n4.4.0.5 4.4. Best Practices for File Paths in Data Science\n\nUse relative paths when working in a project structure, as it allows the project to be portable.\nUse absolute paths when working with external or shared files that aren’t part of your project.\nCheck the current working directory to ensure you are referencing files correctly.\nAvoid hardcoding file paths directly in the code to make your code reusable on different machines.\nUse the forward slash (/) as a path separator or os.path.join to specify file path if your code will work across different operating systems"

By default, the row indices are integers starting from zero. However, both the row indices and column names can be customized by the user.\nLet us read the spotify data - spotify_data.csv, using the Pandas function read_csv().\n\nspotify_data = pd.read_csv('../Data/spotify_data.csv')\nspotify_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nartist_followers\ngenres\nartist_name\nartist_popularity\ntrack_name\ntrack_popularity\nduration_ms\nexplicit\nrelease_year\ndanceability\n...\nkey\nloudness\nmode\nspeechiness\nacousticness\ninstrumentalness\nliveness\nvalence\ntempo\ntime_signature\n\n\n\n\n0\n16996777\nrap\nJuice WRLD\n96\nAll Girls Are The Same\n0\n165820\n1\n2021\n0.673\n...\n0\n-7.226\n1\n0.3060\n0.0769\n0.000338\n0.0856\n0.203\n161.991\n4\n\n\n1\n16996777\nrap\nJuice WRLD\n96\nLucid Dreams\n0\n239836\n1\n2021\n0.511\n...\n6\n-7.230\n0\n0.2000\n0.3490\n0.000000\n0.3400\n0.218\n83.903\n4\n\n\n2\n16996777\nrap\nJuice WRLD\n96\nHear Me Calling\n0\n189977\n1\n2021\n0.699\n...\n7\n-3.997\n0\n0.1060\n0.3080\n0.000036\n0.1210\n0.499\n88.933\n4\n\n\n3\n16996777\nrap\nJuice WRLD\n96\nRobbery\n0\n240527\n1\n2021\n0.708\n...\n2\n-5.181\n1\n0.0442\n0.3480\n0.000000\n0.2220\n0.543\n79.993\n4\n\n\n4\n5988689\nrap\nRoddy Ricch\n88\nBig Stepper\n0\n175170\n0\n2021\n0.753\n...\n8\n-8.469\n1\n0.2920\n0.0477\n0.000000\n0.1970\n0.616\n76.997\n4\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 21 columns\n\n\n\nThe object spotify_data is a pandas DataFrame:\n\ntype(spotify_data)\n\npandas.core.frame.DataFrame\n\n\nA Series is a one-dimensional array-like object in pandas that contains a sequence of values, where each value is associated with an index. All the values in a Series must have the same data type. Each column of a DataFrame is Series as shown in the example below.\n\n#Extracting song titles from the spotify_songs DataFrame\nspotify_songs = spotify_data['track_name']\nspotify_songs\n\n0                           All Girls Are The Same\n1                                     Lucid Dreams\n2                                  Hear Me Calling\n3                                          Robbery\n4                                      Big Stepper\n                            ...                   \n243185                                    Stardust\n243186             Knockin' A Jug - 78 rpm Version\n243187            When It's Sleepy Time Down South\n243188    On The Sunny Side Of The Street - Part 2\n243189                                    My Sweet\nName: track_name, Length: 243190, dtype: object\n\n\n\n#The object spotify_songs is a Series\ntype(spotify_songs)\n\npandas.core.series.Series\n\n\nA Series is essentially a column, and a DataFrame is a two-dimensional table made up of a collection of Series"

    "text": "7.7 Arithematic operations within and between DataFrames\nPandas is built on top of NumPy, and for arithmetic operations, it inherits many of NumPy’s powerful features. Pandas provides an intuitive and efficient way to perform arithmetic operations both within a DataFrame (on columns or rows) and between multiple DataFrames. These operations are element-wise, meaning they are applied to corresponding elements of the DataFrame or Series.\n\n7.7.1 Arithematic operations within a DataFrame\nYou can easily perform arithmetic operations on columns or rows within a DataFrame\n\nArithmetic Between Columns\n\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndata = {'A': [1, 2, 3],\n        'B': [4, 5, 6],\n        'C': [7, 8, 9]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Adding two columns\ndf['A_plus_B'] = df['A'] + df['B']\n\n# Multiplying two columns\ndf['A_times_C'] = df['A'] * df['C']\n\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nA_plus_B\nA_times_C\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n4\n7\n5\n7\n\n\n1\n2\n5\n8\n7\n16\n\n\n2\n3\n6\n9\n9\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic on Entire Rows\n\n\n# Summing values across columns for each row\ndf['row_sum'] = df.sum(axis=1)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nA_plus_B\nA_times_C\nrow_sum\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n4\n7\n5\n7\n24\n\n\n1\n2\n5\n8\n7\n16\n38\n\n\n2\n3\n6\n9\n9\n27\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.2 Arithematic operations between DataFrames\nWhen performing operations between two DataFrames, pandas aligns the data based on both the index and column labels. If the indices or columns do not match, pandas automatically fills the missing values with NaN (not-a-number) unless a fill value is provided.\nLet us create two toy DataFrames:\n\n#Creating two toy DataFrames\ntoy_df1 = pd.DataFrame([(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)], columns=['a','b'])\ntoy_df2 = pd.DataFrame([(100,200),(300,400),(500,600)], columns=['a','b'])\n\n\n#DataFrame 1\ntoy_df1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n1\n3\n4\n\n\n2\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#DataFrame 2\ntoy_df2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\n100\n200\n\n\n1\n300\n400\n\n\n2\n500\n600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement by element operations between two DataFrames can be performed with the operators +, -, *,/,**, and %. Below is an example of element-by-element addition of two DataFrames:\n\n# Element-by-element arithmetic addition of the two DataFrames\ntoy_df1 + toy_df2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\n101\n202\n\n\n1\n303\n404\n\n\n2\n505\n606\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these operations create problems when the row indices and/or column names of the two DataFrames do not match. See the example below:\n\n#Creating another toy example of a DataFrame\ntoy_df3 = pd.DataFrame([(100,200),(300,400),(500,600)], columns=['a','b'], index=[1,2,3])\ntoy_df3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n1\n100\n200\n\n\n2\n300\n400\n\n\n3\n500\n600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Adding DataFrames with some unmatching row indices\ntoy_df1 + toy_df3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1\n103.0\n204.0\n\n\n2\n305.0\n406.0\n\n\n3\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the rows whose indices match between the two DataFrames are added up. The rest of the values are missing (or NaN) because only one of the DataFrames has that index.\nAs in the case of row indices, missing values will also appear in the case of unmatching column names, as shown in the example below.\n\ntoy_df4 = pd.DataFrame([(100,200),(300,400),(500,600)], columns=['b','c'])\ntoy_df4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\nc\n\n\n\n\n0\n100\n200\n\n\n1\n300\n400\n\n\n2\n500\n600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Adding DataFrames with some unmatching column names\ntoy_df1 + toy_df4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\nc\n\n\n\n\n0\nNaN\n102\nNaN\n\n\n1\nNaN\n304\nNaN\n\n\n2\nNaN\n506\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.3 Arithmetic Between DataFrame and Series (Broadcasting)\nPandas supports broadcasting, where a Series can be broadcasted to match the dimensions of a DataFrame during an arithmetic operation.\n\n# Broadcasting: The row [1,2] (a Series) is added on every row in df2 \ntoy_df1.loc[0,:] + toy_df2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\n101\n202\n\n\n1\n301\n402\n\n\n2\n501\n602\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the + operator is used to add values of a Series to a DataFrame based on column names. For adding a Series to a DataFrame based on row indices, we cannot use the + operator. Instead, we’ll need to use the add() function as explained below.\nBroadcasting based on row/column labels: We can use the add() function to broadcast a Series to a DataFrame. By default the Series adds based on column names, as in the case of the + operator.\n\n# Add the first row of df1 (a Series) to every row in df2 \ntoy_df2.add(toy_df1.loc[0,:])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\n101\n202\n\n\n1\n301\n402\n\n\n2\n501\n602\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor broadcasting based on row indices, we use the axis argument of the add() function.\n\n# The second column of df1 (a Series) is added to every col in df2\ntoy_df2.add(toy_df1.loc[:,'b'],axis='index')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\n102\n202\n\n\n1\n304\n404\n\n\n2\n506\n606\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.4 Converting a DataFrame to a NumPy Array\nIn pandas, you often need to convert a DataFrame or Series into a NumPy array to perform specific operations or to interface with libraries that require NumPy arrays.\nThere are two common methods for converting pandas objects to NumPy arrays: .values and .to_numpy().\n\n7.7.4.1 Using .values\n\nThe .values attribute returns the underlying NumPy array representation of a DataFrame or Series.\nIt provides a direct conversion, but it has been deprecated in favor of the newer .to_numpy() method because .values does not always handle all DataFrame types consistently.\n\n\ntoy_df1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n1\n3\n4\n\n\n2\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoy_df1.values\n\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4],\n       [5, 6]])\n\n\n\n\n7.7.4.2 Using .to_numpy()\n\nThe .to_numpy() method is a recommended way to convert a DataFrame to a NumPy array.\nIt handles different types of data, such as nullable types or mixed data types, more consistently than .values.\nAdditional parameters: .to_numpy() can take parameters like dtype (to specify the data type) and copy (to create a copy or not).\n\n\ntoy_df1.to_numpy()\n\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4],\n       [5, 6]])\n\n\nIn the NumPy chapter, we explored the below case study that demonstrated the benefits of using matrix multiplication in NumPy over python loops. However, this same operation cannot be directly performed in a pandas DataFrame in the same way.\n\nfood_qty = pd.read_csv('../data/food_quantity.csv',index_col=0)\nprice = pd.read_csv('../data/price.csv',index_col=0)\n\n\n%%time\nstore_expense = pd.DataFrame(0.0, columns=price.columns, index = food_qty.index)\nfor person in store_expense.index:\n    for store in store_expense.columns:\n        for food in food_qty.columns:\n            store_expense.loc[person, store] += food_qty.loc[person, food]*price.loc[food, store]\n\nstore_expense\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 5.01 ms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nKroger\n\n\nPerson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen\n50.0\n49.0\n\n\nBarbara\n58.5\n61.0\n\n\nBeth\n43.5\n43.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%time\n# using matrix multiplication in numpy\nimport numpy as np\nnp.dot(food_qty.values, price.values)\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 996 μs\n\n\narray([[50. , 49. ],\n       [58.5, 61. ],\n       [43.5, 43.5]])\n\n\n\n# converting the result to a DataFrame\npd.DataFrame(np.dot(food_qty.values, price.values), columns=price.columns, index=food_qty.index)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nKroger\n\n\nPerson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen\n50.0\n49.0\n\n\nBarbara\n58.5\n61.0\n\n\nBeth\n43.5\n43.5"

Suppose you have listened to the song drivers license. Spotify intends to recommend you 5 songs that are similar to drivers license. Which songs should it recommend?\nLet us see the available song information that can help us identify songs similar to drivers license. The columns attribute of DataFrame will display all the columns names. The description of some of the column names relating to audio features is here.\n\nspotify_data.columns\n\nIndex(['artist_followers', 'genres', 'artist_name', 'artist_popularity',\n       'track_name', 'track_popularity', 'duration_ms', 'explicit',\n       'release_year', 'danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness', 'mode',\n       'speechiness', 'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness',\n       'valence', 'tempo', 'time_signature'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nSolution approach: We have several features of a song. Let us find songs similar to drivers license in terms of danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, time_signature and tempo. Note that we are considering only audio features for simplicity.\nTo find the songs most similar to drivers license, we need to define a measure that quantifies the similarity. Let us define similarity of a song with drivers license as the Euclidean distance of the song from drivers license, where the coordinates of a song are: (danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, time_signature, tempo). Thus, similarity can be formulated as:\n\\[\\scriptsize\nSimilarity_{DL-S} = \\sqrt{(danceability_{DL}-danceability_{S})^2+(energy_{DL}-energy_{S})^2 +\\dots + (tempo_{DL}-tempo_{S})^2}\n\\]\nwhere the subscript DL stands for drivers license and S stands for any song. The top 5 songs with the least value of \\(Similarity_{DL-S}\\) will be the most similar to drivers lincense and should be recommended.\nLet us subset the columns that we need to use to compute the Euclidean distance.\n\naudio_features = spotify_data[['danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness','mode','speechiness',\n                               'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness','valence', 'tempo', 'time_signature']]\n\n\naudio_features.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndanceability\nenergy\nkey\nloudness\nmode\nspeechiness\nacousticness\ninstrumentalness\nliveness\nvalence\ntempo\ntime_signature\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.673\n0.529\n0\n-7.226\n1\n0.3060\n0.0769\n0.000338\n0.0856\n0.203\n161.991\n4\n\n\n1\n0.511\n0.566\n6\n-7.230\n0\n0.2000\n0.3490\n0.000000\n0.3400\n0.218\n83.903\n4\n\n\n2\n0.699\n0.687\n7\n-3.997\n0\n0.1060\n0.3080\n0.000036\n0.1210\n0.499\n88.933\n4\n\n\n3\n0.708\n0.690\n2\n-5.181\n1\n0.0442\n0.3480\n0.000000\n0.2220\n0.543\n79.993\n4\n\n\n4\n0.753\n0.597\n8\n-8.469\n1\n0.2920\n0.0477\n0.000000\n0.1970\n0.616\n76.997\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Distribution of values of audio_features\naudio_features.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndanceability\nenergy\nkey\nloudness\nmode\nspeechiness\nacousticness\ninstrumentalness\nliveness\nvalence\ntempo\ntime_signature\n\n\n\n\ncount\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n\n\nmean\n0.568357\n0.580633\n5.240326\n-9.432548\n0.670928\n0.111984\n0.383938\n0.071169\n0.223756\n0.552302\n119.335060\n3.884177\n\n\nstd\n0.159444\n0.236631\n3.532546\n4.449731\n0.469877\n0.198068\n0.321142\n0.209555\n0.198076\n0.250017\n29.864219\n0.458082\n\n\nmin\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n-60.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n0.462000\n0.405000\n2.000000\n-11.990000\n0.000000\n0.033200\n0.070000\n0.000000\n0.098100\n0.353000\n96.099250\n4.000000\n\n\n50%\n0.579000\n0.591000\n5.000000\n-8.645000\n1.000000\n0.043100\n0.325000\n0.000011\n0.141000\n0.560000\n118.002000\n4.000000\n\n\n75%\n0.685000\n0.776000\n8.000000\n-6.131000\n1.000000\n0.075300\n0.671000\n0.002220\n0.292000\n0.760000\n137.929000\n4.000000\n\n\nmax\n0.988000\n1.000000\n11.000000\n3.744000\n1.000000\n0.969000\n0.996000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n243.507000\n5.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the audio features differ in terms of scale. Some features like key have a wide range of [0,11], while others like danceability have a very narrow range of [0,0.988]. If we use them directly, features like danceability will have a much higher influence on \\(Similarity_{DL-S}\\) as compared to features like key. Assuming we wish all the features to have equal weight in quantifying a song’s similarity to drivers license, we should scale the features, so that their values are comparable.\nLet us scale the value of each column to a standard uniform distribution: \\(U[0,1]\\).\nFor scaling the values of a column to \\(U[0,1]\\), we need to subtract the minimum value of the column from each value, and divide by the range of values of the column. For example, danceability can be standardized as follows:\n\n#Scaling danceability to U[0,1]\ndanceability_value_range = audio_features.danceability.max()-audio_features.danceability.min()\ndanceability_std = (audio_features.danceability-audio_features.danceability.min())/danceability_value_range\ndanceability_std\n\n0         0.681174\n1         0.517206\n2         0.707490\n3         0.716599\n4         0.762146\n            ...   \n243185    0.621457\n243186    0.797571\n243187    0.533401\n243188    0.565789\n243189    0.750000\nName: danceability, Length: 243190, dtype: float64\n\n\nHowever, it will be cumbersome to repeat the above code for each audio feature. We can instead write a function that scales values of a column to \\(U[0,1]\\), and apply the function on all the audio features.\n\n#Function to scale a column to U[0,1]\ndef scale_uniform(x):\n    return (x-x.min())/(x.max()-x.min())\n\nWe will use the Pandas function apply() to apply the above function to the DataFrame audio_features.\n\n#Scaling all audio features to U[0,1]\naudio_features_scaled = audio_features.apply(scale_uniform)\n\nThe above two blocks of code can be concisely written with the lambda function as:\n\naudio_features_scaled = audio_features.apply(lambda x: (x-x.min())/(x.max()-x.min()))\n\n\n#All the audio features are scaled to U[0,1]\naudio_features_scaled.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndanceability\nenergy\nkey\nloudness\nmode\nspeechiness\nacousticness\ninstrumentalness\nliveness\nvalence\ntempo\ntime_signature\n\n\n\n\ncount\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n243190.000000\n\n\nmean\n0.575260\n0.580633\n0.476393\n0.793290\n0.670928\n0.115566\n0.385480\n0.071169\n0.223756\n0.552302\n0.490068\n0.776835\n\n\nstd\n0.161380\n0.236631\n0.321141\n0.069806\n0.469877\n0.204405\n0.322431\n0.209555\n0.198076\n0.250017\n0.122642\n0.091616\n\n\nmin\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n0.467611\n0.405000\n0.181818\n0.753169\n0.000000\n0.034262\n0.070281\n0.000000\n0.098100\n0.353000\n0.394647\n0.800000\n\n\n50%\n0.586032\n0.591000\n0.454545\n0.805644\n1.000000\n0.044479\n0.326305\n0.000011\n0.141000\n0.560000\n0.484594\n0.800000\n\n\n75%\n0.693320\n0.776000\n0.727273\n0.845083\n1.000000\n0.077709\n0.673695\n0.002220\n0.292000\n0.760000\n0.566427\n0.800000\n\n\nmax\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we need to find the Euclidean distance from the song drivers license, let us find the index of the row containing features of drivers license.\n\n#Index of the row consisting of drivers license can be found with the index attribute\ndrivers_license_index = spotify_data[spotify_data.track_name=='drivers license'].index[0]\n\nNote that the object returned by the index attribute is of type pandas.core.indexes.numeric.Int64Index. The elements of this object can be retrieved like the elements of a python list. That is why the object is sliced with [0] to return the first element of the object.

When you use the .plot() method in pandas, it internally calls matplotlib functions to create the plots.\nMatplotlib is:\n\na low-level graph plotting library in python that strives to emulate MATLAB,\ncan be used in Python scripts, Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebooks and web application servers.\nis mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.\n\n\n10.2.1 Matplotlib pyplot\n\nMatplotlib is the whole package; pyplot is a module in matplotlib\nMost of the Matplotlib utilities lies under the pyplot module, and are usually imported under the plt alias:\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Data Source\n\nPython lists, NumPy arrays as well as a pandas series\nHowever, all the sequences are internally converted to numpy arrays.\n\nLet’s create a python list to illustrate basic plotting with Matplotlib pyplot\n\nyield_apples = [0.895, 0.91, 0.919, 0.926, 0.929, 0.931]\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Basic Plotting\n\n10.2.3.1 Plotting the overall trend\n\nplt.plot(yield_apples)\n\n\n\n\nCalling the plt.plot function draws the line chart as expected. It also returns a list of plots drawn [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x2194b571df0&gt;], shown within the output. We can include a semicolon (;) at the end of the last statement in the cell to avoiding showing the output and display just the graph.\n\nplt.plot(yield_apples);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3.2 Customizing the X-axis\nThe X-axis of the plot currently shows list element indexes 0 to 5. The plot would be more informative if we could display the year for which we’re plotting the data. We can do this by two arguments plt.plot.\n\nyears = [2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]\nyield_apples = [0.895, 0.91, 0.919, 0.926, 0.929, 0.931]\n\n\nplt.plot(years, yield_apples);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3.3 Ploting multiple lines\nYou can invoke the plt.plot function once for each line to plot multiple lines in the same graph. Let’s compare the yields of apples vs. oranges.\n\nyears = range(2000, 2012)\napples = [0.895, 0.91, 0.919, 0.926, 0.929, 0.931, 0.934, 0.936, 0.937, 0.9375, 0.9372, 0.939]\noranges = [0.962, 0.941, 0.930, 0.923, 0.918, 0.908, 0.907, 0.904, 0.901, 0.898, 0.9, 0.896, ]\n\n\nplt.plot(years, apples)\nplt.plot(years, oranges);\n\n\n\n\nWhen plt.plot command is called without any formatting parameters, pyplot uses the following defaults: * Figure size: 6.4 X 4.8 inches * Plot style: solid line * Linewidth: 1.5 * Color: Blue (code ‘b’, hex code: ‘#1f77b4’)\nYou can also edit default styles directly by modifying the matplotlib.rcParams dictionary. Learn more: https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#matplotlib-rcparams .\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams['font.size'] = 14\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (7, 4)\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = '#00000000'\n\nConceptual model: Plotting requires action on a range of levels, ranging from the size of the figure to the text object in the plot. Matplotlib provides object-oriented interface in the hierarchical fashion to provide complete control over the plot. The user generates and keeps track of the figure and axes objects. These axes objects are then used for most plotting actions.\n\n\n\n10.2.4 Enhancing the plot\nMatplotlib provides a wide range of customizable components within a figure, allowing for fine-tuned control over every aspect of the plot. These components include elements like axes, labels, ticks, legends, and the overall layout. Each can be tailored to enhance the clarity, aesthetics, and effectiveness of the visual representation, making the plot more engaging and easier to interpret.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Matplotlib anatomy of a figure\n\n\n\n\n10.2.4.1 Adding Axis Lables\nWe can add labels to the axes to show what each axis represents using the plt.xlabel and plt.ylabel methods.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples)\nplt.plot(years, oranges)\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.4.2 Adding Chart Title and Legend\nTo differentiate between multiple lines, we can include a legend within the graph using the plt.legend function. We can also set a title for the chart using the plt.title function.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples)\nplt.plot(years, oranges)\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.4.3 Adding Line Markers\nWe can also show markers for the data points on each line using the marker argument of plt.plot. Matplotlib provides many different markers, like a circle, cross, square, diamond, etc. You can find the full list of marker types here.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, marker='o')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, marker='x')\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.4.4 Styling Lines and Markers\nThe plt.plot function supports many arguments for styling lines and markers:\n\ncolor or c: Set the color of the line (supported colors)\nlinestyle or ls: Choose between a solid or dashed line\nlinewidth or lw: Set the width of a line\nmarkersize or ms: Set the size of markers\nmarkeredgecolor or mec: Set the edge color for markers\nmarkeredgewidth or mew: Set the edge width for markers\nmarkerfacecolor or mfc: Set the fill color for markers\nalpha: Opacity of the plot\n\nCheck out the documentation for plt.plot to learn more: https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot .\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, marker='s', c='b', ls='-', lw=2, ms=8, mew=2, mec='navy')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, marker='o', c='r', ls='--', lw=3, ms=10, alpha=.5)\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\nThe fmt argument provides a shorthand for specifying the marker shape, line style, and line color. It can be provided as the third argument to plt.plot.\nfmt = '[marker][line][color]'\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, 's-b')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, 'o--r')\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t specify a line style in fmt, only markers are drawn.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, 'sb')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, 'or')\nplt.title(\"Yield (tons per hectare)\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.4.5 Changing the Figure Size\nYou can use the plt.figure function to change the size of the figure.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\n\nplt.plot(years, oranges, 'or')\nplt.title(\"Yield of Oranges (tons per hectare)\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.5 Real World Examples\nDownload data from Canvas (gas_prices.csv & fifa_data.csv)\n\nimport pandas as pd\ngas = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/gas_prices.csv')\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\n\nplt.title('Gas Prices over Time (in USD)', fontdict={'fontweight':'bold', 'fontsize': 18})\n\nplt.plot(gas.Year, gas.USA, 'b.-', label='United States')\nplt.plot(gas.Year, gas.Canada, 'r.-')\nplt.plot(gas.Year, gas['South Korea'], 'g.-')\nplt.plot(gas.Year, gas.Australia, 'y.-')\n\n# Another Way to plot many values!\n# countries_to_look_at = ['Australia', 'USA', 'Canada', 'South Korea']\n# for country in gas:\n#     if country in countries_to_look_at:\n#         plt.plot(gas.Year, gas[country], marker='.')\n\nplt.xticks(gas.Year[::3].tolist()+[2011])\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('US Dollars')\n\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.6 Plotting other types of plots\nLet’s read the fifa data\n\nfifa = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/fifa_data.csv')\nfifa.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\nID\nName\nAge\nPhoto\nNationality\nFlag\nOverall\nPotential\nClub\n...\nComposure\nMarking\nStandingTackle\nSlidingTackle\nGKDiving\nGKHandling\nGKKicking\nGKPositioning\nGKReflexes\nRelease Clause\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n158023\nL.

It is not a data visualization library but, we can create basic plots using Pandas. Pandas is highly useful and practical if we want to create exploratory data analysis plots. We do not need to import other data visualization libraries in addition to Pandas for such tasks.\n\ncovid_df = pd.read_csv('../data/covid.csv')\ncovid_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nnew_cases\ntotal_cases\nnew_deaths\ntotal_deaths\nnew_tests\ntotal_tests\ncases_per_million\ndeaths_per_million\ntests_per_million\n\n\n\n\n0\n2019-12-31\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n1\n2020-01-01\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n2\n2020-01-02\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n3\n2020-01-03\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n4\n2020-01-04\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot(kind='line', color='b', label='New Cases', linewidth=1, alpha=0.5, grid=True, linestyle=':')\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this plot shows the overall trend, it’s hard to tell where the peak occurred, as there are no dates on the X-axis. We can use the date column as the index for the data frame to address this issue since it is a time series dataset\n\ncovid_df.set_index('date', inplace=True)\n\n\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot(kind='line', color='b', label='New Cases', linewidth=1, alpha=0.5, grid=True, linestyle=':')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncovid_df.new_deaths.plot(kind='line', color='r', label='New Deaths', linewidth=1, alpha=0.5, grid=True, linestyle='--')\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot(kind='line', color='g', label='New Tests', linewidth=1, alpha=0.5, grid=True, linestyle='-.')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, Pandas generates line plots when using the plot method. However, you can create other types of visualizations by setting the kind parameter in the plot function. The kind parameter accepts eleven different string values, which specify the type of plot:\n\n“area” is for area plots.\n“bar” is for vertical bar charts.\n“barh” is for horizontal bar charts.\n“box” is for box plots.\n“hexbin” is for hexbin plots.\n“hist” is for histograms.\n“kde” is for kernel density estimate charts.\n“density” is an alias for “kde”.\n“line” is for line graphs.\n“pie” is for pie charts.\n“scatter” is for scatter plots.\n\nFor more information, check out the official Pandas documentation:\n\nSeries.plot\nDataFrame.plot\n\n\ncovid_df.plot(kind='scatter', x='new_cases', y='new_deaths', color='r', alpha=0.5);\n\n\n\n\nLook at the distribution of a proterty with a histogram. Then you’ll get to know some tools to examine the outliers\n\ncovid_df.new_deaths.plot(kind='hist', color='r', alpha=0.5, bins=50);\n\n\n\n\n\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot(kind='box');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Plotting with Seaborn\nSeaborn is a powerful data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, designed to make statistical plots easier and more attractive. It integrates seamlessly with Pandas, making it an excellent tool for plotting data from DataFrames. Seaborn comes with better default aesthetics and provides more specialized plots that are easy to implement.\nSome of the key advantages of using Seaborn include:\n\nSimpler syntax: Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex plots with just a few lines of code.\nBeautiful default styles: Seaborn’s default plots are more polished and aesthetically pleasing compared to Matplotlib’s defaults.\nSeamless Pandas integration: You can directly pass Pandas DataFrames to Seaborn, and it understands column names for axis labels and plot elements.\n\nseaborn comes with 17 built-in datasets. That means you don’t have to spend a whole lot of your time finding the right dataset and cleaning it up to make Seaborn-ready; rather you will focus on the core features of Seaborn visualization techniques to solve problems.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n# get names of the builtin dataset\nsns.get_dataset_names()\n\n['anagrams',\n 'anscombe',\n 'attention',\n 'brain_networks',\n 'car_crashes',\n 'diamonds',\n 'dots',\n 'dowjones',\n 'exercise',\n 'flights',\n 'fmri',\n 'geyser',\n 'glue',\n 'healthexp',\n 'iris',\n 'mpg',\n 'penguins',\n 'planets',\n 'seaice',\n 'taxis',\n 'tips',\n 'titanic']\n\n\nLet’s do a few common plots with Seaborn tips dataset\n\n# Load data into a Pandas dataframe\nflowers_df = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\nflowers_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal_length\nsepal_width\npetal_length\npetal_width\nspecies\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.1 Scatter plots using sns.scatterplot():\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, y=flowers_df.sepal_width);\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.1.1 Adding Hues to the scatterplot\nNotice how the points in the above plot seem to form distinct clusters with some outliers. We can color the dots using the flower species as a hue. We can also make the points larger using the s argument.\n\nflowers_df.species.unique()\n\narray(['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, y=flowers_df.sepal_width, hue=flowers_df.species, s=100);\n\n\n\n\nAdding hues makes the plot more informative. We can immediately tell that Setosa flowers have a smaller sepal length but higher sepal widths. In contrast, the opposite is true for Virginica flowers.\n\n\n8.2.2.1.2 Customizing Seaborn Figures\nSince Seaborn uses Matplotlib’s plotting functions internally, we can use functions like plt.figure and plt.title to modify the figure.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.title('Sepal Dimensions')\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, \n                y=flowers_df.sepal_width, \n                hue=flowers_df.species,\n                s=100);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.1.3 Integration with Pandas Data Frames\nSeaborn has in-built support for Pandas data frames. Instead of passing each column as a series, you can provide column names and use the data argument to specify a data frame.\n\nplt.title('Sepal Dimensions')\nsns.scatterplot(x='sepal_length', \n                y='sepal_width', \n                hue='species',\n                s=100,\n                data=flowers_df);\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting histgram using sns.histplot():\n\n\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x='sepal_width');\n\n\n\n\n\n# show kde(kernal density estimate)\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x='sepal_width', kde=True);\n\n\n\n\n\n# adding hue\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x=\"sepal_width\", hue=\"species\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.2 Barplot using sns.barplot\n\ntips_df = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\nsns.barplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.barplot(x='day', y='tip', hue='sex', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n# make the bars horizontal simply by switching the axes\nsns.barplot(x='tip', y='day', hue='sex', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.3 Heatmap using sns.heatmap()\nRepresent 2-dimensional data like a matrix or table using colors\n\nflights_df = sns.load_dataset(\"flights\").pivot(index=\"month\", columns=\"year\", values=\"passengers\")\nflights_df\n# you will learn pivot in the later chapters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1956\n1957\n1958\n1959\n1960\n\n\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan\n112\n115\n145\n171\n196\n204\n242\n284\n315\n340\n360\n417\n\n\nFeb\n118\n126\n150\n180\n196\n188\n233\n277\n301\n318\n342\n391\n\n\nMar\n132\n141\n178\n193\n236\n235\n267\n317\n356\n362\n406\n419\n\n\nApr\n129\n135\n163\n181\n235\n227\n269\n313\n348\n348\n396\n461\n\n\nMay\n121\n125\n172\n183\n229\n234\n270\n318\n355\n363\n420\n472\n\n\nJun\n135\n149\n178\n218\n243\n264\n315\n374\n422\n435\n472\n535\n\n\nJul\n148\n170\n199\n230\n264\n302\n364\n413\n465\n491\n548\n622\n\n\nAug\n148\n170\n199\n242\n272\n293\n347\n405\n467\n505\n559\n606\n\n\nSep\n136\n158\n184\n209\n237\n259\n312\n355\n404\n404\n463\n508\n\n\nOct\n119\n133\n162\n191\n211\n229\n274\n306\n347\n359\n407\n461\n\n\nNov\n104\n114\n146\n172\n180\n203\n237\n271\n305\n310\n362\n390\n\n\nDec\n118\n140\n166\n194\n201\n229\n278\n306\n336\n337\n405\n432\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflights_df is a matrix with one row for each month and one column for each year. The values show the number of passengers (in thousands) that visited the airport in a specific month of a year. We can use the sns.heatmap function to visualize the footfall at the airport.\n\nplt.title(\"No. of Passengers (1000s)\")\nsns.heatmap(flights_df);\n\n\n\n\nThe brighter colors indicate a higher footfall at the airport. By looking at the graph, we can infer two things:\n\nThe footfall at the airport in any given year tends to be the highest around July & August.\nThe footfall at the airport in any given month tends to grow year by year.\n\nWe can also display the actual values in each block by specifying annot=True and using the cmap argument to change the color palette.\n\n# fmt = \"d\" decimal integer. output are the number in base 10\nplt.title(\"No. of Passengers (1000s)\")\nsns.heatmap(flights_df, fmt=\"d\", annot=True, cmap='Blues');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.4 Correlation Map\nA correlation map is a specific type of heatmap where the values represent the correlation coefficients between variables (ranging from -1 to 1). It visually shows the strength and direction of relationships between numerical variables.\nCorrelation may refer to any kind of association between two random variables. However, in this book, we will always consider correlation as the linear association between two random variables, or the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Note that correlation does not imply causality and vice-versa.\nThe Pandas function corr() provides the pairwise correlation between all columns of a DataFrame, or between two Series. The function corrwith() provides the pairwise correlation of a DataFrame with another DataFrame or Series.\n\n#Pairwise correlation amongst all columns\nsurvey_data =

Seaborn\nPurpose: Boxplots is a standardized way of visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable. They show five key metrics that describe the data distribution - median, 25th percentile value, 75th percentile value, minimum and maximum, as shown in the figure below. Note that the minimum and maximum exclude the outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Make a boxplot comparing the distributions of maximum temperatures of Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, given whether or not it has rained on the day.\n\nsns.boxplot(data = aussie_weather,x = 'Location', y = 'MaxTemp',hue = 'RainToday')\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel='Location', ylabel='MaxTemp'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot, we observe that: 1. The maximum temperature of the day, on an average, is lower if it rained on the day. 2. Sydney and Melbourne have some extremely high outlying values of maximum temperature.\nWe have used the Seaborn boxplot() function for the above plot.\n\n\n8.2.2.6 Scatterplots with Seaborn\nWe made scatterplots with Matplotlib and Pandas earlier. With Seaborn, the regplot() function allows us to plot a trendline over the scatterplot, along with a 95% confidence interval for the trendline. Note that this is much easier than making a trendline with Matplotlib.\n\n#Scatterplot and trendline with seaborn\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (9,6)\nsns.set(font_scale=1.5)\nax=sns.regplot(x = 'gdpPercap', y = 'lifeExp', data = gdp_data,scatter_kws={\"color\": \"orange\"}, line_kws={\"color\": \"blue\"})\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\nax.set_xlabel('GDP per capita')\nax.set_ylabel('Life expectancy')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Life expectancy')\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the confidence interval of the trendline broadens as we move farther away from most of the data points. In other words, there is more uncertainty about the trend as we move to a domain space farther away from the data.\n\n\n8.2.2.7 Multiple plots in a single figure using Seaborn\nPurpose: Histogram and density plots visualize the distribution of a continuous variable.\nA histogram plots the number of observations occurring within discrete, evenly spaced bins of a random variable, to visualize the distribution of the variable. It may be considered a special case of a bar plot as bars are used to plot the observation counts.\nA density plot uses a kernel density estimate to approximate the distribution of random variable.\nWe can use the Seaborn displot() function to make both kinds of plots - histogram or density plot.\nExample: Make a histogram showing the distributions of maximum temperature in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.\n\naussie_weather = pd.read_csv('../Data/Australia_weather.csv')\naussie_weather.head()\n\nsns.set(font_scale = 1.4)\na = sns.displot(data = aussie_weather, x = 'MaxTemp',kind = 'hist',col='Location')\na.set_axis_labels(\"Maximum temperature\", \"Count\")\na.set_titles(\"{col_name}\")\n\n&lt;seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x14c944cfc20&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot, we observe that: 1. Melbourne has a right skewed distribution with the median temperature being smaller than the mean. 2. Canberra seems to have the highest variation in the temperature.\nExample: Make a density plot showing the distributions of maximum temperature in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.\n\nsns.displot(data = aussie_weather, x = 'MaxTemp',kind = 'kde', col = 'Location')\n\n&lt;seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x14c9acc5040&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Show the distributions of the maximum and minimum temperatures in a single plot.\n\nsns.histplot(data=aussie_weather, x=\"MaxTemp\", color=\"skyblue\", label=\"MaxTemp\", kde=True)\nsns.histplot(data=aussie_weather, x=\"MinTemp\", color=\"red\", label=\"MinTemp\", kde=True)\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel('Temperature')\n\nText(0.5, 0, 'Temperature')\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seaborn function histplot() can be used to make a density plot overlapping on a histogram."

    "text": "5.2 Using Pandas to Read CSVs\nPandas is a popular Python library used for working in tabular data (similar to the data stored in a spreadsheet). Pandas provides helper functions to read data from various file formats like CSV, Excel spreadsheets, HTML tables, JSON, SQL, and more.\nThe below format of storing data is known as comma-separated values or CSV. It contains day-wise Covid-19 data for Italy:\ndate,new_cases,new_deaths,new_tests\n2020-04-21,2256.0,454.0,28095.0\n2020-04-22,2729.0,534.0,44248.0\n2020-04-23,3370.0,437.0,37083.0\n2020-04-24,2646.0,464.0,95273.0\n2020-04-25,3021.0,420.0,38676.0\n2020-04-26,2357.0,415.0,24113.0\n2020-04-27,2324.0,260.0,26678.0\n2020-04-28,1739.0,333.0,37554.0\n...\n\nCSVs: A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields. (Wikipedia)\n\nFirst, let’s import the Pandas library. As a convention, it is imported with the alias pd.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\n\n5.2.1 Using the read_csv function\nThe pd.read_csv function can be used to read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame: a spreadsheet-like object for analyzing and processing data.\n\nmovie_ratings = pd.read_csv('../data/movie_ratings.csv')\n\nThe built-in python function type can be used to check the dataype of an object:\n\ntype(movie_ratings)\n\npandas.core.frame.DataFrame\n\n\nWe’ll learn more about DataFrame in a future lesson.\nNote that I use the relative path to specify the file path for movie_ratings.csv, you may need to change it based on where you store the data file.\n\n\n5.2.2 Data Overview\nOnce the data has been read, we may want to see what the data looks like. We’ll use another Pandas function head() to view the first few rows of the data.\n\nmovie_ratings.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nUS Gross\nWorldwide Gross\nProduction Budget\nRelease Date\nMPAA Rating\nSource\nMajor Genre\nCreative Type\nIMDB Rating\nIMDB Votes\n\n\n\n\n0\nOpal Dreams\n14443\n14443\n9000000\nNov 22 2006\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nDrama\nFiction\n6.5\n468\n\n\n1\nMajor Dundee\n14873\n14873\n3800000\nApr 07 1965\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nWestern/Musical\nFiction\n6.7\n2588\n\n\n2\nThe Informers\n315000\n315000\n18000000\nApr 24 2009\nR\nAdapted screenplay\nHorror/Thriller\nFiction\n5.2\n7595\n\n\n3\nBuffalo Soldiers\n353743\n353743\n15000000\nJul 25 2003\nR\nAdapted screenplay\nComedy\nFiction\n6.9\n13510\n\n\n4\nThe Last Sin Eater\n388390\n388390\n2200000\nFeb 09 2007\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nDrama\nFiction\n5.7\n1012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow Indices and column names (axis labels)\nBy default, when you create a pandas DataFrame (or Series) without specifying an index, pandas will automatically assign integer-based row indices starting from 0. These indices serve as the row labels and uniquely identify each row in the DataFrame. For example, the index 2 correponds to the row of the movie The Informers. By default, the indices are integers starting from 0. However, they can be changed (to even non-integer values) if desired by the user.\nThe bold text on top of the DataFrame refers to column names. For example, the column US Gross consists of the gross revenue of a movie in the US.\nCollectively, the indices and column names are referred as axis labels.\nBasic information We can view some basic information about the data frame using the .info method.\n\nmovie_ratings.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 2228 entries, 0 to 2227\nData columns (total 11 columns):\n #   Column             Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------             --------------  -----  \n 0   Title              2228 non-null   object \n 1   US Gross           2228 non-null   int64  \n 2   Worldwide Gross    2228 non-null   int64  \n 3   Production Budget  2228 non-null   int64  \n 4   Release Date       2228 non-null   object \n 5   MPAA Rating        2228 non-null   object \n 6   Source             2228 non-null   object \n 7   Major Genre        2228 non-null   object \n 8   Creative Type      2228 non-null   object \n 9   IMDB Rating        2228 non-null   float64\n 10  IMDB Votes         2228 non-null   int64  \ndtypes: float64(1), int64(4), object(6)\nmemory usage: 191.6+ KB\n\n\nThe shape property of a pandas DataFrame provides a tuple that represents the dimensions of the DataFrame:\n\nThe first value in the tuple is the number of rows.\nThe second value in the tuple is the number of columns.\n\n\nmovie_ratings.shape\n\n(2228, 11)\n\n\nThe columns property contains the list of columns within the data frame.\n\nmovie_ratings.columns\n\nIndex(['Title', 'US Gross', 'Worldwide Gross', 'Production Budget',\n       'Release Date', 'MPAA Rating', 'Source', 'Major Genre', 'Creative Type',\n       'IMDB Rating', 'IMDB Votes'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nYou can view statistical information for numerical columns (mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, and the number of non-empty values) using the .describe method.\n\nmovie_ratings.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Gross\nWorldwide Gross\nProduction Budget\nIMDB Rating\nIMDB Votes\n\n\n\n\ncount\n2.228000e+03\n2.228000e+03\n2.228000e+03\n2228.000000\n2228.000000\n\n\nmean\n5.076370e+07\n1.019370e+08\n3.816055e+07\n6.239004\n33585.154847\n\n\nstd\n6.643081e+07\n1.648589e+08\n3.782604e+07\n1.243285\n47325.651561\n\n\nmin\n0.000000e+00\n8.840000e+02\n2.180000e+02\n1.400000\n18.000000\n\n\n25%\n9.646188e+06\n1.320737e+07\n1.200000e+07\n5.500000\n6659.250000\n\n\n50%\n2.838649e+07\n4.266892e+07\n2.600000e+07\n6.400000\n18169.000000\n\n\n75%\n6.453140e+07\n1.200000e+08\n5.300000e+07\n7.100000\n40092.750000\n\n\nmax\n7.601676e+08\n2.767891e+09\n3.000000e+08\n9.200000\n519541.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions & Methods we’ve looked so far\n\npd.read_csv - Read data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame object\n.info() - View basic infomation about rows, columns & data types\n.shape - Get the number of rows & columns as a tuple\n.columns - Get the list of column names\n.describe() - View statistical information about numeric columns"

The object data type is a catch-all for columns that contain mixed types or types that aren’t easily categorized.\n\n5.4.1 Available Data Types and Associated Built-in Functions\nIn a DataFrame, columns can have different data types. Here are the common data types you’ll encounter and some built-in functions associated with each type:\n\nNumerical Data (int, float)\n\nBuilt-in functions: mean(), sum(), min(), max(), std(), median(), quantile(), etc.\n\nObject Data (str or mixed types)\n\nBuilt-in functions: str.contains(), str.startswith(), str.endswith(), str.lower(), str.upper(), str.replace(), etc.\n\nDatetime Data (datetime64)\n\nBuilt-in functions: dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.strftime(), dt.weekday(), dt.hour, etc.\n\n\nThese functions help in exploring and transforming the data effectively depending on the type of data in each column.\n\n\n5.4.2 Data Type Conversion\nWhen you work on a specific column, being mindful of which data type it is, the data type depends on its built in function.\nOften, we need to convert the datatypes of some of the columns to make them suitable for analysis. For example, the datatype of Release Date in the DataFrame movie_ratings is object. To perform datetime related computations on this variable, we’ll need to convert it to a datatime format. We’ll use the Pandas function to_datatime() to covert it to a datatime format. Similar functions such as to_numeric(), to_string() etc., can be used for other conversions.\n\nmovie_ratings['Release Date']\n\n0       Nov 22 2006\n1       Apr 07 1965\n2       Apr 24 2009\n3       Jul 25 2003\n4       Feb 09 2007\n           ...     \n2223    Jul 07 2004\n2224    Jun 19 1998\n2225    May 14 2010\n2226    Jun 14 1991\n2227    Jan 23 1998\nName: Release Date, Length: 2228, dtype: object\n\n\n\n# check the datatype of release data column \nmovie_ratings['Release Date'].dtypes\n\ndtype('O')\n\n\nWe can see above that the function to_datetime() converts Release Date to a datetime format.\nNext, we’ll update the variable Release Date in the DataFrame to be in the datetime format:\n\nmovie_ratings['Release Date'] = pd.to_datetime(movie_ratings['Release Date'])\n\n\n# Let's check the datatype of release data column again\nmovie_ratings['Release Date'].dtypes\n\ndtype('&lt;M8[ns]')\n\n\ndtype('&lt;M8[ns]') means a 64-bit datetime object with nanosecond precision stored in little-endian format. This data type is commonly used to represent timestamps in high-resolution time series data.\nNext, we can use the built-in datetime functions to extract the year from this variable and create the ‘release year’ column.\n\n# Extracting the year from the release date\nmovie_ratings['Release Year'] = movie_ratings['Release Date'].dt.year\nmovie_ratings.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nUS Gross\nWorldwide Gross\nProduction Budget\nRelease Date\nMPAA Rating\nSource\nMajor Genre\nCreative Type\nIMDB Rating\nIMDB Votes\nRelease Year\nratio_wgross_by_budget\n\n\n\n\n0\nOpal Dreams\n14443\n14443\n9000000\n2006-11-22\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nDrama\nFiction\n6.5\n468\n2006\n0.001605\n\n\n1\nMajor Dundee\n14873\n14873\n3800000\n1965-04-07\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nWestern/Musical\nFiction\n6.7\n2588\n1965\n0.003914\n\n\n2\nThe Informers\n315000\n315000\n18000000\n2009-04-24\nR\nAdapted screenplay\nHorror/Thriller\nFiction\n5.2\n7595\n2009\n0.017500\n\n\n3\nBuffalo Soldiers\n353743\n353743\n15000000\n2003-07-25\nR\nAdapted screenplay\nComedy\nFiction\n6.9\n13510\n2003\n0.023583\n\n\n4\nThe Last Sin Eater\n388390\n388390\n2200000\n2007-02-09\nPG/PG-13\nAdapted screenplay\nDrama\nFiction\n5.7\n1012\n2007\n0.176541\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pandas, the errors='coerce' parameter is often used in the context of data conversion, specifically when using the pd.to_numeric function.

A couple of benefits of the JSON format are:\n\nSince the format is text only, JSON data can easily be exchanged between web applications, and used by any programming language.\nUnlike the csv format, JSON supports a hierarchical data structure, and is easier to integrate with APIs.\n\nThe JSON format can support a hierachical data structure, as it is built on the following two data structures (Source: technical documentation):\n\nA collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\nAn ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n\nThese are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.\nThe Pandas function read_json converts a JSON string to a Pandas DataFrame. The function dumps() of the json library converts a Python object to a JSON string.\nLets read the JSON data on Ted Talks.\n\ntedtalks_data = pd.read_json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwkenwaysun/TEDmap/master/data/TED_Talks.json')\n\n\ntedtalks_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nspeaker\nheadline\nURL\ndescription\ntranscript_URL\nmonth_filmed\nyear_filmed\nevent\nduration\ndate_published\ntags\nnewURL\ndate\nviews\nrates\n\n\n\n\n0\n7\nDavid Pogue\nSimplicity sells\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/7\nNew York Times columnist David Pogue takes aim...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/7/transcript?...\n2\n2006\nTED2006\n0:21:26\n6/27/06\nsimplicity,computers,software,interface design...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/david_pogue_says_sim...\n2006-06-27\n1646773\n[{'id': 7, 'name': 'Funny', 'count': 968}, {'i...\n\n\n1\n6\nCraig Venter\nSampling the ocean's DNA\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/6\nGenomics pioneer Craig Venter takes a break fr...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/6/transcript?...\n7\n2005\nTEDGlobal 2005\n0:16:51\n2004/05/07\nbiotech,invention,oceans,genetics,DNA,biology,...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_on_dna_...\n2004-05-07\n562625\n[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Courageous', 'count': 21},...\n\n\n2\n4\nBurt Rutan\nThe real future of space exploration\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/4\nIn this passionate talk, legendary spacecraft ...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/4/transcript?...\n2\n2006\nTED2006\n0:19:37\n10/25/06\naircraft,flight,industrial design,NASA,rocket ...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/burt_rutan_sees_the_...\n2006-10-25\n2046869\n[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Courageous', 'count': 169}...\n\n\n3\n3\nAshraf Ghani\nHow to rebuild a broken state\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/3\nAshraf Ghani's passionate and powerful 10-minu...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/3/transcript?...\n7\n2005\nTEDGlobal 2005\n0:18:45\n10/18/06\ncorruption,poverty,economics,investment,milita...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/ashraf_ghani_on_rebu...\n2006-10-18\n814554\n[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Courageous', 'count': 140}...\n\n\n4\n5\nChris Bangle\nGreat cars are great art\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/5\nAmerican designer Chris Bangle explains his ph...\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/5/transcript?...\n2\n2002\nTED2002\n0:20:04\n2004/05/07\ncars,industrial design,transportation,inventio...\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/chris_bangle_says_gr...\n2004-05-07\n870950\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Beautiful', 'count': 89}, ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[{'question': \"What is the data type of values in the last column (named 'rates') of the above dataset on ted talks\",\n  'type': 'multiple_choice',\n  'answers': [{'answer': 'list', 'correct': True, 'feedback': 'Correct!'},\n   {'answer': 'string',\n    'correct': False,\n    'feedback': 'Incorrect.

We can use the date column as the index for the data frame to address this issue since it is a time series dataset\n\ncovid_df.set_index('date', inplace=True)\n\n\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot()\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncovid_df[['new_deaths', 'new_cases']].plot()\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, pandas generates line plots when using the .plot method. However, there are several parameters you can adjust to enhance the appearance of the line plot.\n\ncovid_df[['new_deaths', 'new_cases']].plot(figsize=(12, 6), linewidth=2, marker='o')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create other types of visualizations by setting the kind parameter in the plot function. The kind parameter accepts eleven different string values, which specify the type of plot:\n\n“area” is for area plots.\n“bar” is for vertical bar charts.\n“barh” is for horizontal bar charts.\n“box” is for box plots.\n“hexbin” is for hexbin plots.\n“hist” is for histograms.\n“kde” is for kernel density estimate charts.\n“density” is an alias for “kde”.\n“line” is for line graphs.\n“pie” is for pie charts.\n“scatter” is for scatter plots.\n\nFor more information, check out the official Pandas documentation:\n\nSeries.plot\nDataFrame.plot\n\n\ncovid_df.plot(kind='scatter', x='new_cases', y='new_deaths', color='r', alpha=0.5);\n\n\n\n\nLook at the distribution of a proterty with a histogram.

For complex visualizations, you might need to switch to matplotlib for more control.\nPlot Types: The range of plot types available in pandas is limited compared to what you can create with matplotlib or seaborn. For instance, advanced plots like violin plots or 3D plots require switching to other libraries.\nAesthetic Choices: The default aesthetics in pandas may not be as visually appealing as those created using seaborn or other specialized visualization libraries.

    "section": "10.3 Plotting with Seaborn",
    "text": "10.3 Plotting with Seaborn\nSeaborn is a powerful data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, designed to make statistical plots easier and more attractive. It integrates seamlessly with Pandas, making it an excellent tool for plotting data from DataFrames. Seaborn comes with better default aesthetics and provides more specialized plots that are easy to implement.\nSome of the key advantages of using Seaborn include:\n\nSimpler syntax: Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex plots with just a few lines of code.\nBeautiful default styles: Seaborn’s default plots are more polished and aesthetically pleasing compared to Matplotlib’s defaults.\nSeamless Pandas integration: You can directly pass Pandas DataFrames to Seaborn, and it understands column names for axis labels and plot elements.\n\nseaborn comes with 17 built-in datasets. That means you don’t have to spend a whole lot of your time finding the right dataset and cleaning it up to make Seaborn-ready; rather you will focus on the core features of Seaborn visualization techniques to solve problems.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n# get names of the builtin dataset\nsns.get_dataset_names()\n\n['anagrams',\n 'anscombe',\n 'attention',\n 'brain_networks',\n 'car_crashes',\n 'diamonds',\n 'dots',\n 'dowjones',\n 'exercise',\n 'flights',\n 'fmri',\n 'geyser',\n 'glue',\n 'healthexp',\n 'iris',\n 'mpg',\n 'penguins',\n 'planets',\n 'seaice',\n 'taxis',\n 'tips',\n 'titanic']\n\n\n\n10.3.1 Customizing Plot Aesthetics with sns.set_style()\nSeaborn provides a convenient function called sns.set_style() that allows users to customize the visual appearance of their plots. This function is particularly useful for enhancing the aesthetics of visualizations, making them more appealing and easier to interpret.\n\n10.3.1.1 Purpose of sns.set_style()\nThe primary purpose of sns.set_style() is to set the visual context and style for all plots created after the call. This allows for a consistent and visually pleasing representation of data across multiple visualizations.\n\n\n10.3.1.2 Available Style Options\nSeaborn offers several built-in styles that can be set using sns.set_style(). The options include:\n\ndarkgrid:\n\nA dark background with a grid overlay.\nIdeal for visualizing data with many points or intricate details.\n\nwhitegrid:\n\nA white background with a grid overlay.\nProvides a clean and professional look, suitable for most types of visualizations.\n\ndark:\n\nA dark background without gridlines.\nUseful for emphasizing data points without distractions from the grid.\n\nwhite:\n\nA simple white background without gridlines.\nOffers a minimalist aesthetic, focusing solely on the data.\n\nticks:\n\nA white background with ticks on the axes.\nCombines the clarity of a white background with a bit of added detail for reference.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.1.3 How to Use sns.set_style()\nTo apply a specific style, simply call sns.set_style() with the desired style name before creating your plots. Here’s an example:\n\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n\nLet’s do a few common plots with Seaborn tips dataset\n\n# Load data into a Pandas dataframe\nflowers_df = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\nflowers_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal_length\nsepal_width\npetal_length\npetal_width\nspecies\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2 Scatterplot\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, y=flowers_df.sepal_width);\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2.0.1 Adding Hues to the scatterplot\nNotice how the points in the above plot seem to form distinct clusters with some outliers. We can color the dots using the flower species as a hue. We can also make the points larger using the s argument.\n\nflowers_df.species.unique()\n\narray(['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, y=flowers_df.sepal_width, hue=flowers_df.species, s=100);\n\n\n\n\nAdding hues makes the plot more informative. We can immediately tell that Setosa flowers have a smaller sepal length but higher sepal widths. In contrast, the opposite is true for Virginica flowers.\n\n\n10.3.2.0.2 Customizing Seaborn Figures\nSince Seaborn uses Matplotlib’s plotting functions internally, we can use functions like plt.figure and plt.title to modify the figure.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.title('Sepal Dimensions')\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, \n                y=flowers_df.sepal_width, \n                hue=flowers_df.species,\n                s=100);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2.0.3 Integration with Pandas Data Frames\nSeaborn has in-built support for Pandas data frames. Instead of passing each column as a series, you can provide column names and use the data argument to specify a data frame.\n\nplt.title('Sepal Dimensions')\nsns.scatterplot(x='sepal_length', \n                y='sepal_width', \n                hue='species',\n                s=100,\n                data=flowers_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Histgram\n\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x='sepal_width');\n\n\n\n\n\n# show kde(kernal density estimate)\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x='sepal_width', kde=True);\n\n\n\n\n\n# adding hue\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x=\"sepal_width\", hue=\"species\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.4 Barplot\n\ntips_df = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\nsns.barplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.barplot(x='day', y='tip', hue='sex', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n# make the bars horizontal simply by switching the axes\nsns.barplot(x='tip', y='day', hue='sex', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.5 Boxplot\nPurpose: Boxplots is a standardized way of visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable. They show five key metrics that describe the data distribution - median, 25th percentile value, 75th percentile value, minimum and maximum, as shown in the figure below. Note that the minimum and maximum exclude the outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Create a box plot to compare the distributions of total tips based on the day of the week, differentiating between male and female patrons.\n\nsns.boxplot(data=tips_df, y='total_bill', x='day', hue='sex');\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot, what you can observe?\n\n\n10.3.6 Heatmap:\nRepresent 2-dimensional data like a matrix or table using colors\n\nflights_df = sns.load_dataset(\"flights\").pivot(index=\"month\", columns=\"year\", values=\"passengers\")\nflights_df\n# you will learn pivot in the later chapters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1956\n1957\n1958\n1959\n1960\n\n\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan\n112\n115\n145\n171\n196\n204\n242\n284\n315\n340\n360\n417\n\n\nFeb\n118\n126\n150\n180\n196\n188\n233\n277\n301\n318\n342\n391\n\n\nMar\n132\n141\n178\n193\n236\n235\n267\n317\n356\n362\n406\n419\n\n\nApr\n129\n135\n163\n181\n235\n227\n269\n313\n348\n348\n396\n461\n\n\nMay\n121\n125\n172\n183\n229\n234\n270\n318\n355\n363\n420\n472\n\n\nJun\n135\n149\n178\n218\n243\n264\n315\n374\n422\n435\n472\n535\n\n\nJul\n148\n170\n199\n230\n264\n302\n364\n413\n465\n491\n548\n622\n\n\nAug\n148\n170\n199\n242\n272\n293\n347\n405\n467\n505\n559\n606\n\n\nSep\n136\n158\n184\n209\n237\n259\n312\n355\n404\n404\n463\n508\n\n\nOct\n119\n133\n162\n191\n211\n229\n274\n306\n347\n359\n407\n461\n\n\nNov\n104\n114\n146\n172\n180\n203\n237\n271\n305\n310\n362\n390\n\n\nDec\n118\n140\n166\n194\n201\n229\n278\n306\n336\n337\n405\n432\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflights_df is a matrix with one row for each month and one column for each year. The values show the number of passengers (in thousands) that visited the airport in a specific month of a year. We can use the sns.heatmap function to visualize the footfall at the airport.\n\nplt.title(\"No. of Passengers (1000s)\")\nsns.heatmap(flights_df);\n\n\n\n\nThe brighter colors indicate a higher footfall at the airport. By looking at the graph, we can infer two things:\n\nThe footfall at the airport in any given year tends to be the highest around July & August.\nThe footfall at the airport in any given month tends to grow year by year.\n\nWe can also display the actual values in each block by specifying annot=True and using the cmap argument to change the color palette.\n\n# fmt = \"d\" decimal integer. output are the number in base 10\nplt.title(\"No. of Passengers (1000s)\")\nsns.heatmap(flights_df, fmt=\"d\", annot=True, cmap='Blues');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.7 Correlation Map\nA correlation map is a specific type of heatmap where the values represent the correlation coefficients between variables (ranging from -1 to 1). It visually shows the strength and direction of relationships between numerical variables.\nCorrelation may refer to any kind of association between two random variables. However, in this book, we will always consider correlation as the linear association between two random variables, or the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Note that correlation does not imply causality and vice-versa.\nThe Pandas function corr() provides the pairwise correlation between all columns of a DataFrame, or between two Series. The function corrwith() provides the pairwise correlation of a DataFrame with another DataFrame or Series.\n\n#Pairwise correlation amongst all columns\nsurvey_data =

single figure using Seaborn\nPurpose: Histogram and density plots visualize the distribution of a continuous variable.\nA histogram plots the number of observations occurring within discrete, evenly spaced bins of a random variable, to visualize the distribution of the variable. It may be considered a special case of a bar plot as bars are used to plot the observation counts.\nA density plot uses a kernel density estimate to approximate the distribution of random variable.\nWe can use the Seaborn displot() function to make both kinds of plots - histogram or density plot.\nExample: Make a histogram showing the distributions of total bill on each day of the week\n\nsns.set(font_scale = 1.4)\na = sns.displot(data = tips_df, x = 'total_bill',kind = 'hist',col='day')\na.set_axis_labels(\"Maximum temperature\", \"Count\")\na.set_titles(\"{col_name}\")\n\n\n\n\nExample: Make a density plot showing the distributions of total bills on each day.\n\nsns.displot(data = tips_df, x = 'total_bill',kind = 'kde', col = 'day');"

    "text": "8.1 The Art of Visualization: Choosing the Right Plot Type\nThere are various types of plots available, and selecting the appropriate one is crucial for successful data visualization. The choice primarily depends on two factors: * The type of data you are working with, and * The role of visualization in your data analysis\n\n8.1.1 Data Classification for Visualization\nData visualization is commonly used to plot data in a pandas DataFrame. The data can be classified into two categories:\n\nNumeric Data: This type of data represents quantities and can take any value within a range. Common examples include age, height, temperature, etc.\nCategorical Data: This type of data represents distinct categories or groups. It can be nominal (no inherent order, like colors or names) or ordinal (with a defined order, like ratings).\n\n\n\n8.1.2 The Role of Visualization in Data Analysis\nData visualization is essential for effectively communicating insights derived from data analysis. By using various visualization techniques, we can uncover patterns, and understand relationships. Below, we discuss different types of data exploration and the relevant visualizations used for each.\n\n8.1.2.1 Univariate Exploration\nPurpose: Univariate exploration analyzes a single variable to understand its distribution, central tendency, and spread.\n\n8.1.2.1.1 Common Visualizations:\n\nHistograms: Display the frequency distribution of a numeric variable, helping to identify the shape of the data (e.g., normal, skewed).\nBox Plots: Summarize key statistics of a variable, including median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\nBar Plots: Show the count or proportion of categorical variables, revealing the frequency of each category.\nLine Plots: Used to display trends in numeric data over time, helping to visualize changes in a variable.\n\n\n\n8.1.2.1.2 Insights Gained:\n\nIdentify outliers and anomalies.\nUnderstand the range and distribution of values.\nDetermine central tendency (mean, median, mode).\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2.2 Bivariate Analysis\nPurpose: Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables, helping to understand how changes in one variable might affect another.\n\n8.1.2.2.1 Common Visualizations:\n\nScatter Plots: Illustrate the relationship between two numeric variables, highlighting trends and correlations.\nGrouped Bar Plots: Compare categorical variables against a numeric variable, revealing trends across categories.\nHeatmaps: Represent correlation coefficients between pairs of variables, allowing easy identification of strong correlations.\n\n\n\n8.1.2.2.2 Insights Gained:\n\nAssess the strength and direction of relationships (positive, negative, or no correlation).\nIdentify potential predictive relationships for further analysis.\nDiscover patterns that may indicate causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2.3 Multivariate Analysis\nPurpose: Multivariate analysis investigates more than two variables simultaneously, providing a comprehensive view of complex relationships and interactions.\n\n8.1.2.3.1 Common Visualizations:\n\nPair Plots: Show pairwise relationships in a dataset, facilitating quick insights into correlations among multiple variables.\n3D Scatter Plots: Visualize the interaction between three numeric variables in a three-dimensional space.\nFacet Grids: Display multiple plots for different subsets of data, enabling comparisons across categories.\n\n\n\n8.1.2.3.2 Insights Gained:\n\nUnderstand interactions and dependencies among multiple variables.\nIdentify clusters or groups within the data.\nEnhance predictive modeling by considering multiple influences.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Summary\nChoosing the appropriate plot depends on the data type and the specific analysis purpose. Numeric data typically requires plots that can handle continuous data (like line plots or histograms), while categorical data often benefits from comparisons (like bar plots or pie charts). Always consider what story you want to tell with your data and select your visualization method accordingly."

    "text": "8.2 Visulization Tools\nWe’ll use three libraries for making data visualizations - pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.\nTo get started, let’s import these libraries.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# let's import numpy as well\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n8.2.1 Basic Plotting with Pandas\nIn previous chapters, we focused on using the pandas library for data reading and analysis. In addition to its powerful data manipulation capabilities, pandas also provides tools for creating basic plots, making it especially valuable for exploratory data analysis.\nIn this section, we will use the COVID dataset to demonstrate basic plotting techniques with pandas.\n\ncovid_df = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/covid.csv')\ncovid_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nnew_cases\ntotal_cases\nnew_deaths\ntotal_deaths\nnew_tests\ntotal_tests\ncases_per_million\ndeaths_per_million\ntests_per_million\n\n\n\n\n0\n2019-12-31\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n1\n2020-01-01\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n2\n2020-01-02\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n3\n2020-01-03\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n4\n2020-01-04\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\n0.0\n0.0\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s begin by visualizing the trend of new COVID cases over time using a line plot.\nA line plot is ideal for showing changes over continuous data, such as the progression of new cases over a series of dates.\n\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot()\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this plot shows the overall trend, it’s hard to tell where the peak occurred, as there are no dates on the X-axis. We can use the date column as the index for the data frame to address this issue since it is a time series dataset\n\ncovid_df.set_index('date', inplace=True)\n\n\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot(rot=45)\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the date set as the index, we can observe that the peak occurred around March 2020. Next, let’s plot both new cases and new deaths together to compare their trends over the same time period.\n\ncovid_df[['new_deaths', 'new_cases']].plot()\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, pandas generates line plots when using the .plot method. However, there are several parameters you can adjust to enhance the appearance of the line plot.\n\ncovid_df[['new_deaths', 'new_cases']].plot(figsize=(12, 6), linewidth=2, marker='o')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='date'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create other types of visualizations by setting the kind parameter in the plot function. The kind parameter accepts eleven different string values, which specify the type of plot:\n\n“area” is for area plots.\n“bar” is for vertical bar charts.\n“barh” is for horizontal bar charts.\n“box” is for box plots.\n“hexbin” is for hexbin plots.\n“hist” is for histograms.\n“kde” is for kernel density estimate charts.\n“density” is an alias for “kde”.\n“line” is for line graphs.\n“pie” is for pie charts.\n“scatter” is for scatter plots.\n\nLet’s next create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between new cases and new deaths, and explore whether there’s a correlation between them.\n\ncovid_df.plot(kind='scatter', x='new_cases', y='new_deaths', color='r', alpha=0.5);\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s examine the distribution of new deaths using a histogram.\n\ncovid_df.new_deaths.plot(kind='hist', color='r', alpha=0.5, bins=50);\n\n\n\n\n\ncovid_df.new_cases.plot(kind='box');\n\n\n\n\nFor more plot types and detailed information, refer to the official pandas documentation:\n\nSeries.plot\nDataFrame.plot\n\n\n8.2.1.1 Limitation of using pandas for plotting\nWhile pandas provides a straightforward way to create plots, there are some limitations to be aware of:\n\nCustomization: Pandas offers basic customization options, but it may not provide the level of detail or flexibility that you can achieve with matplotlib directly. For complex visualizations, you might need to switch to matplotlib for more control.\nPlot Types: The range of plot types available in pandas is limited compared to what you can create with matplotlib or seaborn. For instance, advanced plots like violin plots or 3D plots require switching to other libraries.\nAesthetic Choices: The default aesthetics in pandas may not be as visually appealing as those created using seaborn or other specialized visualization libraries. For polished presentations, additional customization might be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Data Plotting with Matplotlib Pyplot Interface\nPandas data visualization is built on top of matplotlib. When you use the .plot() method in pandas, it internally calls matplotlib functions to create the plots.\nMatplotlib is:\n\na low-level graph plotting library in python that strives to emulate MATLAB,\ncan be used in Python scripts, Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebooks and web application servers.\nis mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.\n\n\n8.2.2.1 Matplotlib pyplot\n\nMatplotlib is the whole package; pyplot is a module in matplotlib\nMost of the Matplotlib utilities lies under the pyplot module, and are usually imported under the plt alias:\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n8.2.2.2 Data Source\n\nPython lists, NumPy arrays as well as a pandas series\nHowever, all the sequences are internally converted to numpy arrays.\n\nLet’s create a python list to illustrate basic plotting with Matplotlib pyplot\n\nyield_apples = [0.895, 0.91, 0.919, 0.926, 0.929, 0.931]\n\n\n\n8.2.2.3 Basic Plotting\n\n8.2.2.3.1 Plotting the overall trend\n\nplt.plot(yield_apples)\n\n\n\n\nCalling the plt.plot function draws the line chart as expected. It also returns a list of plots drawn [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x2194b571df0&gt;], shown within the output. We can include a semicolon (;) at the end of the last statement in the cell to avoiding showing the output and display just the graph.\n\nplt.plot(yield_apples);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.3.2 Customizing the X-axis\nThe X-axis of the plot currently shows list element indexes 0 to 5. The plot would be more informative if we could display the year for which we’re plotting the data. We can do this by two arguments plt.plot.\n\nyears = [2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]\nyield_apples = [0.895, 0.91, 0.919, 0.926, 0.929, 0.931]\n\n\nplt.plot(years, yield_apples);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.3.3 Ploting multiple lines\nYou can invoke the plt.plot function once for each line to plot multiple lines in the same graph. Let’s compare the yields of apples vs. oranges.\n\nyears = range(2000, 2012)\napples = [0.895, 0.91, 0.919, 0.926, 0.929, 0.931, 0.934, 0.936, 0.937, 0.9375, 0.9372, 0.939]\noranges = [0.962, 0.941, 0.930, 0.923, 0.918, 0.908, 0.907, 0.904, 0.901, 0.898, 0.9, 0.896, ]\n\n\nplt.plot(years, apples)\nplt.plot(years, oranges);\n\n\n\n\nWhen plt.plot command is called without any formatting parameters, pyplot uses the following defaults:\n\nFigure size: 6.4 X 4.8 inches\nPlot style: solid line\nLinewidth: 1.5\nColor: Blue (code ‘b’, hex code: ‘#1f77b4’)\n\nYou can also edit default styles directly by modifying the matplotlib.rcParams dictionary. Learn more: https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#matplotlib-rcparams .\nYou can customize default plot styles by directly modifying the matplotlib.rcParams dictionary. For more details, visit the official Matplotlib guide on customizing with rcParams.\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams['font.size'] = 14\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (7, 4)\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = '#00000000'\n\nConceptual model: Plotting in Matplotlib involves multiple levels of control, from setting the figure size to customizing individual text elements. To offer complete control over the plotting process, Matplotlib provides an object-oriented interface in a hierarchical structure. This approach allows users to create and manage Figure and Axes objects, which serve as the foundation for all plotting actions. In the next chapter, you will explore how to use this object-oriented interface to gain more precise control over your plots.\n\n\n\n8.2.2.4 Enhancing the plot\nMatplotlib provides a wide range of customizable components within a figure, allowing for fine-tuned control over every aspect of the plot. These components include elements like axes, labels, ticks, legends, and the overall layout. Each can be tailored to enhance the clarity, aesthetics, and effectiveness of the visual representation, making the plot more engaging and easier to interpret.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Matplotlib anatomy of a figure\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.4.1 Adding Axis Lables\nWe can add labels to the axes to show what each axis represents using the plt.xlabel and plt.ylabel methods.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples)\nplt.plot(years, oranges)\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.4.2 Adding Chart Title and Legend\nTo differentiate between multiple lines, we can include a legend within the graph using the plt.legend function. We can also set a title for the chart using the plt.title function.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples)\nplt.plot(years, oranges)\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.4.3 Adding Line Markers\nWe can also show markers for the data points on each line using the marker argument of plt.plot. Matplotlib provides many different markers, like a circle, cross, square, diamond, etc. You can find the full list of marker types here.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, marker='o')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, marker='x')\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.4.4 Styling Lines and Markers\nThe plt.plot function supports many arguments for styling lines and markers:\n\ncolor or c: Set the color of the line (supported colors)\nlinestyle or ls: Choose between a solid or dashed line\nlinewidth or lw: Set the width of a line\nmarkersize or ms: Set the size of markers\nmarkeredgecolor or mec: Set the edge color for markers\nmarkeredgewidth or mew: Set the edge width for markers\nmarkerfacecolor or mfc: Set the fill color for markers\nalpha: Opacity of the plot\n\nCheck out the documentation for plt.plot to learn more: https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot .\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, marker='s', c='b', ls='-', lw=2, ms=8, mew=2, mec='navy')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, marker='o', c='r', ls='--', lw=3, ms=10, alpha=.5)\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\nThe fmt argument provides a shorthand for specifying the marker shape, line style, and line color. It can be provided as the third argument to plt.plot.\nfmt = '[marker][line][color]'\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, 's-b')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, 'o--r')\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Yield (tons per hectare)')\n\nplt.title(\"Crop Yields in Kanto\")\nplt.legend(['Apples', 'Oranges']);\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t specify a line style in fmt, only markers are drawn.\n\nplt.plot(years, apples, 'sb')\nplt.plot(years, oranges, 'or')\nplt.title(\"Yield (tons per hectare)\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.4.5 Changing the Figure Size\nYou can use the plt.figure function to change the size of the figure.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\n\nplt.plot(years, oranges, 'or')\nplt.title(\"Yield of Oranges (tons per hectare)\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.5 Plotting other types of plots with matplotlib pyplot\nLet’s read the fifa_data.csv as our data source\n\nfifa = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/fifa_data.csv')\nfifa.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\nID\nName\nAge\nPhoto\nNationality\nFlag\nOverall\nPotential\nClub\n...\nComposure\nMarking\nStandingTackle\nSlidingTackle\nGKDiving\nGKHandling\nGKKicking\nGKPositioning\nGKReflexes\nRelease Clause\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n158023\nL.

Next, you’ll explore how to simplify and enhance your visualizations by using its powerful wrappers: Pandas and Seaborn.\n\n\n\n8.2.2.6 Limitations of Using Matplotlib for Plotting\nMatplotlib is a popular visualization library, but it has flaws.\n\nDefaults are not ideal (gridlines, background, etc need to be configured.)\nLibrary is low-level (doing anything complicated takes quite a bit of codes)\nLack of integration with pandas data structures\n\nTo address these challenges, Seaborn act as higher-level interfaces to Matplotlib, offering better defaults, simpler syntax, and seamless integration with DataFrames.\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Plotting with Seaborn\nSeaborn is a powerful data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, designed to make statistical plots easier and more attractive. It integrates seamlessly with Pandas, making it an excellent tool for plotting data from DataFrames. Seaborn comes with better default aesthetics and provides more specialized plots that are easy to implement.\nSome of the key advantages of using Seaborn include:\n\nSimpler syntax: Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex plots with just a few lines of code.\nBeautiful default styles: Seaborn’s default plots are more polished and aesthetically pleasing compared to Matplotlib’s defaults.\nSeamless Pandas integration: You can directly pass Pandas DataFrames to Seaborn, and it understands column names for axis labels and plot elements.\n\nseaborn comes with 17 built-in datasets. That means you don’t have to spend a whole lot of your time finding the right dataset and cleaning it up to make Seaborn-ready; rather you will focus on the core features of Seaborn visualization techniques to solve problems.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n# get names of the builtin dataset\nsns.get_dataset_names()\n\n['anagrams',\n 'anscombe',\n 'attention',\n 'brain_networks',\n 'car_crashes',\n 'diamonds',\n 'dots',\n 'dowjones',\n 'exercise',\n 'flights',\n 'fmri',\n 'geyser',\n 'glue',\n 'healthexp',\n 'iris',\n 'mpg',\n 'penguins',\n 'planets',\n 'seaice',\n 'taxis',\n 'tips',\n 'titanic']\n\n\n\n8.2.3.1 Customizing Plot Aesthetics\nSeaborn provides a convenient function called sns.set_style() that allows users to customize the visual appearance of their plots. This function is particularly useful for enhancing the aesthetics of visualizations, making them more appealing and easier to interpret.\n\n8.2.3.1.1 Purpose of sns.set_style()\nThe primary purpose of sns.set_style() is to set the visual context and style for all plots created after the call. This allows for a consistent and visually pleasing representation of data across multiple visualizations.\n\n\n8.2.3.1.2 Available Style Options\nSeaborn offers several built-in styles that can be set using sns.set_style(). The options include:\n\ndarkgrid:\n\nA dark background with a grid overlay.\nIdeal for visualizing data with many points or intricate details.\n\nwhitegrid:\n\nA white background with a grid overlay.\nProvides a clean and professional look, suitable for most types of visualizations.\n\ndark:\n\nA dark background without gridlines.\nUseful for emphasizing data points without distractions from the grid.\n\nwhite:\n\nA simple white background without gridlines.\nOffers a minimalist aesthetic, focusing solely on the data.\n\nticks:\n\nA white background with ticks on the axes.\nCombines the clarity of a white background with a bit of added detail for reference.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.1.3 How to Use sns.set_style()\nTo apply a specific style, simply call sns.set_style() with the desired style name before creating your plots. Here’s an example:\n\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n\nLet’s do a few common plots with Seaborn tips dataset\n\n# Load data into a Pandas dataframe\nflowers_df = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\nflowers_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal_length\nsepal_width\npetal_length\npetal_width\nspecies\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.2 Scatterplot\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, y=flowers_df.sepal_width);\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.2.1 Adding Hues to the scatterplot\nNotice how the points in the above plot seem to form distinct clusters with some outliers. We can color the dots using the flower species as a hue. We can also make the points larger using the s argument.\n\nflowers_df.species.unique()\n\narray(['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, y=flowers_df.sepal_width, hue=flowers_df.species, s=100);\n\n\n\n\nAdding hues makes the plot more informative. We can immediately tell that Setosa flowers have a smaller sepal length but higher sepal widths. In contrast, the opposite is true for Virginica flowers.\n\n\n8.2.3.2.2 Customizing Seaborn Figures\nSince Seaborn uses Matplotlib’s plotting functions internally, we can use functions like plt.figure and plt.title to modify the figure.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.title('Sepal Dimensions')\n\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, \n                y=flowers_df.sepal_width, \n                hue=flowers_df.species,\n                s=100);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.2.3 Integration with Pandas Data Frames\nSeaborn has in-built support for Pandas data frames. Instead of passing each column as a series, you can provide column names and use the data argument to specify a data frame.\n\nplt.title('Sepal Dimensions')\nsns.scatterplot(x='sepal_length', \n                y='sepal_width', \n                hue='species',\n                s=100,\n                data=flowers_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.3 Histgram\n\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x='sepal_width');\n\n\n\n\n\n# show kde(kernal density estimate)\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x='sepal_width', kde=True);\n\n\n\n\n\n# adding hue\nsns.histplot(data=flowers_df, x=\"sepal_width\", hue=\"species\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.4 Barplot\n\ntips_df = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\nsns.barplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.barplot(x='day', y='tip', hue='sex', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n# make the bars horizontal simply by switching the axes\nsns.barplot(x='tip', y='day', hue='sex', data=tips_df);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.5 Boxplot\nPurpose: Boxplots is a standardized way of visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable. They show five key metrics that describe the data distribution - median, 25th percentile value, 75th percentile value, minimum and maximum, as shown in the figure below. Note that the minimum and maximum exclude the outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Create a box plot to compare the distributions of total tips based on the day of the week, differentiating between male and female patrons.\n\nsns.boxplot(data=tips_df, y='total_bill', x='day', hue='sex');\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot, what you can observe?\n\n\n8.2.3.6 Heatmap\nRepresent 2-dimensional data like a matrix or table using colors\n\nflights_df = sns.load_dataset(\"flights\").pivot(index=\"month\", columns=\"year\", values=\"passengers\")\nflights_df\n# you will learn pivot in the later chapters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1956\n1957\n1958\n1959\n1960\n\n\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan\n112\n115\n145\n171\n196\n204\n242\n284\n315\n340\n360\n417\n\n\nFeb\n118\n126\n150\n180\n196\n188\n233\n277\n301\n318\n342\n391\n\n\nMar\n132\n141\n178\n193\n236\n235\n267\n317\n356\n362\n406\n419\n\n\nApr\n129\n135\n163\n181\n235\n227\n269\n313\n348\n348\n396\n461\n\n\nMay\n121\n125\n172\n183\n229\n234\n270\n318\n355\n363\n420\n472\n\n\nJun\n135\n149\n178\n218\n243\n264\n315\n374\n422\n435\n472\n535\n\n\nJul\n148\n170\n199\n230\n264\n302\n364\n413\n465\n491\n548\n622\n\n\nAug\n148\n170\n199\n242\n272\n293\n347\n405\n467\n505\n559\n606\n\n\nSep\n136\n158\n184\n209\n237\n259\n312\n355\n404\n404\n463\n508\n\n\nOct\n119\n133\n162\n191\n211\n229\n274\n306\n347\n359\n407\n461\n\n\nNov\n104\n114\n146\n172\n180\n203\n237\n271\n305\n310\n362\n390\n\n\nDec\n118\n140\n166\n194\n201\n229\n278\n306\n336\n337\n405\n432\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflights_df is a matrix with one row for each month and one column for each year. The values show the number of passengers (in thousands) that visited the airport in a specific month of a year. We can use the sns.heatmap function to visualize the footfall at the airport.\n\nplt.title(\"No. of Passengers (1000s)\")\nsns.heatmap(flights_df);\n\n\n\n\nThe brighter colors indicate a higher footfall at the airport. By looking at the graph, we can infer two things:\n\nThe footfall at the airport in any given year tends to be the highest around July & August.\nThe footfall at the airport in any given month tends to grow year by year.\n\nWe can also display the actual values in each block by specifying annot=True and using the cmap argument to change the color palette.\n\n# fmt = \"d\" decimal integer. output are the number in base 10\nplt.title(\"No. of Passengers (1000s)\")\nsns.heatmap(flights_df, fmt=\"d\", annot=True, cmap='Blues');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.7 Correlation Map\nA correlation map is a specific type of heatmap where the values represent the correlation coefficients between variables (ranging from -1 to 1). It visually shows the strength and direction of relationships between numerical variables.\nCorrelation may refer to any kind of association between two random variables. However, in this book, we will always consider correlation as the linear association between two random variables, or the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Note that correlation does not imply causality and vice-versa.\nThe Pandas function corr() provides the pairwise correlation between all columns of a DataFrame, or between two Series. The function corrwith() provides the pairwise correlation of a DataFrame with another DataFrame or Series.\n\n#Pairwise correlation amongst all columns\nsurvey_data =

However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity.\nWrite your code in the Code cells and your answer in the Markdown cells of the Jupyter notebook. Ensure that the solution is written neatly enough to understand and grade.\nUse Quarto to print the .ipynb file as HTML. You will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: quarto render filename.ipynb --to html. Submit the HTML file.\nThe assignment is worth 100 points, and is due on 21th October 2024 at 11:59 pm.\nFive points are properly formatting the assignment. The breakdown is as follows:\n\n\nMust be an HTML file rendered using Quarto (2 pts).\nThere aren’t excessively long outputs of extraneous information (e.g. no printouts of entire data frames without good reason, there aren’t long printouts of which iteration a loop is on, there aren’t long sections of commented-out code, etc.) (1 pt)\nFinal answers of each question are written in Markdown cells (1 pt).\nThere is no piece of unnecessary / redundant code, and no unnecessary / redundant text (1 pt)"

This question will guide you in finding the location of installing 50 air quality sensors in the State of Colorado, such that they are as far away from each other as possible. The approach below is a greedy algorithm to find an approximate Maximin design.\nThe file colorado_coordinate_grid.txt contains the coordinate-pairs (latitude and longitude) of potential locations for installing an air quality sensor.\n\nB.1.1 Data\nRead the file with NumPy.

Find the coordinate-pair of the location where the first sensor will be installed. The coordinate-pair of Denver is: [39.7392\\(^{\\circ}\\) N, 104.9903\\(^{\\circ}\\) W]\nNote that the suffixes \\(^{\\circ}\\) N and \\(^{\\circ}\\) W are omitted in the file colorado_coordinate_grid.txt.\nHint: Broadcasting\n(4 points)\n\n\nB.1.3 Second sensor\nFind the coordinate-pair of the installation of the next sensor, such that it is as far as possible from the first sensor installed near Denver.\nHint: Broadcasting\n(4 points)\n\n\nB.1.4 First two sensors\nStack the coordinate-pairs of the first and second sensors vertically to obtain a 2 x 2 NumPy array. Name the array as air_sensor_coordinates.\nRun the code below to check if your results seem correct. The coordinate-pairs of the two air quality sensors will be marked as blue dots.\n(4 points)\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndef sensor_viz():\n    img = plt.imread(\"colorado.jpg\")\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 100),dpi=80)\n    fig.set_size_inches(10.5, 15)\n    ax.imshow(img,extent=[-109, -102, 37, 41])\n    plt.scatter(y = air_sensor_coordinates[:,0], x = -air_sensor_coordinates[:,1])\n    plt.xlim(-109.05,-101.95)\n    plt.ylim(36.95,41.05)\n    plt.xlabel(\"Longitude\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Latitude\")\nsensor_viz()\n\n\n\n\nB.1.5 Third sensor\nNow you need to find the coordinate-pair for installing the third sensor such that it is far away from the two already-installed sensors. Proceed as follows:\n\nFind the minimum distance of each coordinate-pair in colorado_coordinate_grid.txt from the two already installed sensors. For example, if a coordinate-pair is at a distance of 5 units from the first sensor, and 10 units from the second sensor, then its minimum distance from the sensors will be \\(\\min(5,10) = 5\\) units.\nSelect the coordinate-pair (from colorado_coordinate_grid.txt) whose minimum distance from the two already installed sensors is the maximum.\nStack the coordinate-pair of the third air quality sensor vertically on the array air_sensor_coordinates.\n\nCall the function sensor_viz() to check if your results seem correct. The coordinate-pairs of the three air quality sensors will be marked as blue dots.\nHint:\nFor step (1) above:\n\nDefine a function which computes the distances of a coordinate-pair from all the coordinates of air_sensor_coordinates, and returns the minimum distance.\nApply the function on all the coordinate-pairs in colorado_coordinate_grid.txt using the NumPy function apply_along_axis().\n\n(20 points)\n\n\nB.1.6 All 50 sensors\nYou need to find 47 more coordinate-pairs to install air quality sensors well-spread across Colorado. We will generalize the steps in the previous question to proceed as follows:\n\nSuppose you have already found the coordinate-pairs for the installation of i sensors.\nFind the minimum distance of each coordinate in colorado_coordinate_grid.txt from the i already installed sensors. For example, if a coordinate-pair is at a distance of \\(d_1\\) from the first sensor, \\(d_2\\) from the second sensor,…, and \\(d_i\\) from the \\(i^{th}\\) sensor, then its minimum distance from the sensors will be \\(min(d_1, d_2, ..., d_i\\)).\nSelect the \\(i+1^{th}\\) coordinate-pair (from colorado_coordinate_grid.txt) as the one whose minimum distance from the \\(i\\) already installed sensors is the maximum.\n\nCall the function sensor_viz() to check if your results seem correct. You should see 50 blue dots well spread across Colorado.\n(10 points)"

Further to x-axis for example, there are ticks and further to ticks there are its subsequent properties and so on.\n\n\n9.2.1.1 Figure\nThe outermost object is the figure which is an instance of figure.Figure. It is the top level container for all the plot elements. The Figure is the final image that may contain one or more Axes and it keeps track of all the Axes. Figure is only a container and you can not plot data on figure.\n\n# To begin with, we create a fiture instance which provides an empty canvas\nfig = plt.figure()\n\n&lt;Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\nFigure is just a container, note that creating figure using plt.figure() does not automatically create an axes and hence all you can see is the figure object.\n\n\n9.2.1.2 Axes\nAxes is the instance of matplotlib.axes.Axes. Axes is the area on which data are plotted. A given figure can contain many Axes, but a given Axes object can only be in one Figure.\n\n9.2.1.2.1 Creating an Axes Object Explicitly\nIn the OOP interface, Axes objects are usually created using plt.subplots() or plt.figure().add_subplot().\n\n# A figure only contains one axes by default\nfig = plt.figure()\n# add axes to the figure\nax = fig.add_subplot()\n\n\n\n\nWe create a blank axes (area) for plotting, if we need to add more axes to the figure\n\n# create a figure with 4 axes, arranged in 2 rows and 2 columns\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.1.2.2 Components of an Axes Object\nThe Axes object contains several elements that make up the plot\n\nData plotting area: Contains the data (lines, bars, points, etc.).\nX-axis and Y-axis: Controls the axis limits, labels, and ticks.\nTitle and Labels: The overall title and labels for each axis.\nGridlines: Optional lines to help align the data visually.\nSpines: The borders around the plot.\nLegend: An optional component to explain the data series.\nAnnotations: Text or arrows highlighting points of interest.\n\nThis is what makes the Axes object central to any plot in the OOP interface of Matplotlib.\n\n# create data for plotting\nx = np.arange(10)\ny = x**2 \n\n# create a figure and axes\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1) \n\n# plot the data\nax.plot(x,y)\n\n# set the title\nax.set_title(\"Exponential Plot\")\n \n# set the labels of x and y axes\nax.set_xlabel(\"age\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Cell growth\")\n\n# set the limits of x and y axes\nax.set_xlim([0, 10])\nax.set_ylim([0, 100])\n\n# set the ticks of x and y axes\nax.set_xticks(range(0, 11, 2))\nax.set_yticks(range(0, 101, 20))\n\n# add grid\nax.grid(True)\n\n# add legend\nax.legend([\"y = x^2\"], loc = \"upper left\")\n\n# show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Creating Complex Plots with Multiple Subplots\nTo help illustrate subplots in matplotlib, we can cover two scenarios:\n\nsubplots that don’t overlap and\nsubplots inside other subplots\n\n\n9.2.2.1 Plotting non-overlapped subplots\nThis is the most common use case, where multiple plots are placed next to each other in a grid, without overlap. The plt.subplots() function allows for a clean layout where each plot is contained in its own space. You can specify the number of rows and columns to create a grid of subplots.\n\nflowers_df = sns.load_dataset('iris')\ntips_df = sns.load_dataset('tips')\nflights_df = sns.load_dataset(\"flights\").pivot(index=\"month\", columns=\"year\", values=\"passengers\")\n\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Pass the axes into seaborn\naxes[0,0].set_title('Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width')\nsns.scatterplot(x=flowers_df.sepal_length, \n                y=flowers_df.sepal_width, \n                hue=flowers_df.species, \n                s=100, \n                ax=axes[0,0])\n\n# Use the axes for plotting\naxes[0,1].set_title('Distribution of Sepal Width')\nsns.histplot(flowers_df.sepal_width, ax=axes[0,1])\naxes[0,1].legend(['Setosa', 'Versicolor', 'Virginica'])\n\n# Pass the axes into seaborn\naxes[1,0].set_title('Restaurant bills')\nsns.barplot(x='day', y='total_bill', hue='sex', data=tips_df, ax=axes[1,0])\n\n# Pass the axes into seaborn\naxes[1,1].set_title('Flight traffic')\nsns.heatmap(flights_df, cmap='Blues', ax=axes[1,1])\n\nplt.tight_layout(pad=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plt.tight_layout() ensures the subplots do not overlap by adjusting the spacing automatically.\nSeaborn and pandas are wrappers of Matplotlib. To create a Seaborn/pandas plot in a specific Matplotlib subplot, you pass the ax parameter to the its plotting function. This allows you to use their visualization capabilities while fully controlling the layout of the plot using Matplotlib’s plt.subplots()\n\n\n\n9.2.2.2 Plotting Nested Subplots (Subplots Inside Other Subplots)\nYou can create a subplot inside another plot using add_axes() or inset_axes() from matplotlib’s Axes object. This is useful for creating insets or focusing on a specific region within a larger plot.\nSyntax of add_axes()\nax = fig.add_axes([left, bottom, width, height])\nwhere\n\nleft: The x-position (horizontal starting point) of the axes, as a fraction of the figure width (0 to 1).\nbottom: The y-position (vertical starting point) of the axes, as a fraction of the figure height (0 to 1).\nwidth: The width of the axes, as a fraction of the figure width (0 to 1).\nheight: The height of the axes, as a fraction of the figure height (0 to 1).\n\nBelow is an example demonstrating the use of add_axes(). You can also explore the inset_axes() method for creating inset plots with more flexibility\n\n# create inset axes within the main plot axes  \n\nnp.random.seed(19680801)  # Fixing random state for reproducibility.\n\n# create some data to use for the plot\ndt = 0.001\nt = np.arange(0.0, 10.0, dt)\nr = np.exp(-t[:1000] / 0.05)  # impulse response\nx = np.random.randn(len(t))\ns = np.convolve(x, r)[:len(x)] * dt  # colored noise\n\nfig, main_ax = plt.subplots()\nmain_ax.plot(t, s)\nmain_ax.set_xlim(0, 1)\nmain_ax.set_ylim(1.1 * np.min(s), 2 * np.max(s))\nmain_ax.set_xlabel('time (s)')\nmain_ax.set_ylabel('current (nA)')\nmain_ax.set_title('Gaussian colored noise')\n\n# this is an inset axes over the main axes\nright_inset_ax = fig.add_axes([.65, .6, .2, .2], facecolor='k')\nright_inset_ax.hist(s, 400, density=True)\nright_inset_ax.set(title='Probability', xticks=[], yticks=[])\n\n# this is another inset axes over the main axes\nleft_inset_ax = fig.add_axes([.2, .6, .2, .2], facecolor='k')\nleft_inset_ax.plot(t[:len(r)], r)\nleft_inset_ax.set(title='Impulse response', xlim=(0, .2), xticks=[], yticks=[])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Advanced Customization with Matplotlib’s Object-Oriented Interface\nBelow, we are reading the dataset of noise complaints of type Loud music/Party received the police in New York City in 2016.\n\nnyc_party_complaints = pd.read_csv('datasets/party_nyc.csv')\nnyc_party_complaints.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated Date\nClosed Date\nLocation Type\nIncident Zip\nCity\nBorough\nLatitude\nLongitude\nHour_of_the_day\nMonth_of_the_year\n\n\n\n\n0\n12/31/2015 0:01\n12/31/2015 3:48\nStore/Commercial\n10034.0\nNEW YORK\nMANHATTAN\n40.866183\n-73.918930\n0\n12\n\n\n1\n12/31/2015 0:02\n12/31/2015 4:36\nStore/Commercial\n10040.0\nNEW YORK\nMANHATTAN\n40.859324\n-73.931237\n0\n12\n\n\n2\n12/31/2015 0:03\n12/31/2015 0:40\nResidential Building/House\n10026.0\nNEW YORK\nMANHATTAN\n40.799415\n-73.953371\n0\n12\n\n\n3\n12/31/2015 0:03\n12/31/2015 1:53\nResidential Building/House\n11231.0\nBROOKLYN\nBROOKLYN\n40.678285\n-73.994668\n0\n12\n\n\n4\n12/31/2015 0:05\n12/31/2015 3:49\nResidential Building/House\n10033.0\nNEW YORK\nMANHATTAN\n40.850304\n-73.938516\n0\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we will begin with basic plotting, utilizing Matplotlib’s object-oriented interface to handle more complex tasks, such as setting the major axis formatting. When it comes to advanced customization, Matplotlib’s object-oriented interface offers greater flexibility and control compared to the pyplot interface.\n\n9.2.3.1 Bar plots with Pandas\nPurpose of bar plots: Barplots are used to visualize any aggregate statistics of a continuous variable with respect to the categories or levels of a categorical variable.\nBar plots can be made using the pandas bar function with the DataFrame or Series, just like the line plots and scatterplots.\nLet us visualise the locations from where the the complaints are coming.\n\nax = nyc_party_complaints['Location Type'].value_counts().plot.bar(ylabel = 'Number of complaints')\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('{x:,.0f}')\n\n\n\n\nIn the above code, we use ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter to format the y-axis labels in a currency style. From the above plot, we observe that most of the complaints come from residential buildings and houses, as one may expect.\nFor categorical variables, we can use the .value_counts() method to get the statistical frequency of each unique value.\n\nnyc_party_complaints['Location Type'].value_counts()\n\nLocation Type\nResidential Building/House    146040\nStreet/Sidewalk                42353\nStore/Commercial               17617\nClub/Bar/Restaurant            15766\nPark/Playground                 3036\nHouse of Worship                 602\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nNext, Let is visualize the time of the year when most complaints occur.\n\nnyc_party_complaints['Month_of_the_year'].value_counts()\n\nMonth_of_the_year\n6     25933\n5     25192\n9     25000\n7     24502\n8     20833\n10    19332\n4     17718\n12    15730\n11    14146\n3     13880\n1     12171\n2     10977\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n#Using the pandas function bar() to create bar plot\nax = nyc_party_complaints['Month_of_the_year'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar(ylabel = 'Number of complaints',\n                                                                              xlabel = \"Month\")\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('{x:,.0f}')\n\n\n\n\nTry executing the code without sort_index() to figure out the purpose of using the function.\nFrom the above plot, we observe that most of the complaints occur during summer and early Fall.\nLet us create a stacked bar chart that combines both the above plots into a single plot.

However, interestingly, there are some complaints at each hour of the day.\nNote that the above barplot shows the mean number of complaints in a month at each hour of the day. The black lines are the 95% confidence intervals of the mean number of complaints.\n\n\n\n9.2.4 pyplot: a convenience wrapper around the object-oriented interface\nWhile the pyplot interface is simpler for quick, basic plots, it ultimately wraps around the object-oriented structure of Matplotlib, meaning that it’s built on top of the object-oriented interface."

    "text": "9.3 Creating Subplots with Seaborn\nWe previously demonstrated how Seaborn integrates seamlessly with Matplotlib’s object-oriented interface, allowing you to pass the ax argument to any Seaborn function, thereby directing the plot to a specific axis within a subplot grid.\nAdditionally, Seaborn offers a more convenient and simplified approach to creating subplots, thanks to its high-level functions and built-in integration with Matplotlib. Here’s how Seaborn makes working with subplots easier:\n\n9.3.1 Using Facetgrid\nSeaborn’s FacetGrid function make it very easy to create facet grids or subplots based on data dimensions (such as categories), which would require more manual effort with Matplotlib.\nYou can use the row and col parameters to control how the data is split into subplots along these dimensions.\n\n# Seaborn Example using FacetGrid:\ntips_df = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\ntips_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal_bill\ntip\nsex\nsmoker\nday\ntime\nsize\n\n\n\n\n0\n16.99\n1.01\nFemale\nNo\nSun\nDinner\n2\n\n\n1\n10.34\n1.66\nMale\nNo\nSun\nDinner\n3\n\n\n2\n21.01\n3.50\nMale\nNo\nSun\nDinner\n3\n\n\n3\n23.68\n3.31\nMale\nNo\nSun\nDinner\n2\n\n\n4\n24.59\n3.61\nFemale\nNo\nSun\nDinner\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng = sns.FacetGrid(tips_df, col='time', row='smoker')\ng.map(sns.histplot, 'total_bill', color='r')\ng.set_titles(col_template=\"{col_name}\", row_template=\"Smoker: {row_name}\");\n\n\n\n\n\n# adding hue to the FacetGrid\ng = sns.FacetGrid(tips_df, col='time', row='smoker',hue='size')\n# Plot a scatterplot of the total bill and tip for each combination of time and smoker\ng.map(sns.scatterplot, 'total_bill', 'tip')\ng.set_titles(col_template=\"{col_name}\", row_template=\"Smoker: {row_name}\");\n\n\n\n\n\n#Visualizing the number of complaints with Month_of_the_year, Location Type, and Borough.\na = sns.FacetGrid(nyc_complaints_grouped, hue = 'Location Type', col = 'Borough',col_wrap=3,height=3.5,aspect = 1)\n# Plotting a lineplot to show the number of complaints with Month_of_the_year\na.map(sns.lineplot,'Month_of_the_year','complaints')\na.set_axis_labels(\"Month of the year\", \"Complaints\")\na.add_legend()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Using Pairplot\nPairplots are used to visualize the association between all variable-pairs in the data. In other words, pairplots simultaneously visualize the scatterplots between all variable-pairs.\nLet us visualize the pair-wise association of tips variables in the tips dataset\n\nsns.pairplot(tips_df );\n\n\n\n\nLet us visualize the pair-wise association of nutrition variables in the starbucks drinks data.\n\nstarbucks_drinks = pd.read_csv('datasets/starbucks-menu-nutrition-drinks.csv')\nsns.pairplot(starbucks_drinks);\n\n\n\n\nIn the above pairplot, note that:\n\nThe histograms on the diagonal of the grid show the distribution of each of the variables.\nInstead of a histogram, we can visualize the density plot with the argument kde = True.\nThe scatterplots in the rest of the grid are the pair-wise plots of all the variables."

It contains geometries (like points, lines, and polygons) that represent features on the earth’s surface, along with associated attributes for each feature, such as names, populations, or other data relevant to the feature.\n\n9.4.1.1 Components of a Shapefile\nA shapefile isn’t a single file but a collection of files with the same name and different extensions, which work together to store geographic and attribute data:\n\n.shp: Stores the geometry (shapes of features, like points, lines, polygons).\n.shx: Contains an index to quickly access geometries in the .shp file.\n.dbf: A table storing attributes associated with each feature.\n\nThere may also be other optional files (e.g., .prj for projection information).\n\n# Create figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))\n\n# Plot your GeoDataFrame\nchicago = gpd.read_file(r'datasets/chicago_boundaries\\geo_export_26bce2f2-c163-42a9-9329-9ca6e082c5e9.shp')\nchicago.plot(column='community', ax=ax, legend=True, legend_kwds={'ncol': 2, 'bbox_to_anchor': (2, 1)})\n\n# Add title (optional)\nplt.title('Chicago Community Areas');\n\n\n\n\nLet’s print out the information in the shapefile\n\nchicago.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narea\narea_num_1\narea_numbe\ncomarea\ncomarea_id\ncommunity\nperimeter\nshape_area\nshape_len\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0\n35\n35\n0.0\n0.0\nDOUGLAS\n0.0\n4.600462e+07\n31027.054510\nPOLYGON ((-87.60914 41.84469, -87.60915 41.844...\n\n\n1\n0.0\n36\n36\n0.0\n0.0\nOAKLAND\n0.0\n1.691396e+07\n19565.506153\nPOLYGON ((-87.59215 41.81693, -87.59231 41.816...\n\n\n2\n0.0\n37\n37\n0.0\n0.0\nFULLER PARK\n0.0\n1.991670e+07\n25339.089750\nPOLYGON ((-87.6288 41.80189, -87.62879 41.8017...\n\n\n3\n0.0\n38\n38\n0.0\n0.0\nGRAND BOULEVARD\n0.0\n4.849250e+07\n28196.837157\nPOLYGON ((-87.60671 41.81681, -87.6067 41.8165...\n\n\n4\n0.0\n39\n39\n0.0\n0.0\nKENWOOD\n0.0\n2.907174e+07\n23325.167906\nPOLYGON ((-87.59215 41.81693, -87.59215 41.816...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchicago['geometry'].head()\n\n0    POLYGON ((-87.60914 41.84469, -87.60915 41.844...\n1    POLYGON ((-87.59215 41.81693, -87.59231 41.816...\n2    POLYGON ((-87.6288 41.80189, -87.62879 41.8017...\n3    POLYGON ((-87.60671 41.81681, -87.6067 41.8165...\n4    POLYGON ((-87.59215 41.81693, -87.59215 41.816...\nName: geometry, dtype: geometry\n\n\n\n# Check the column names to see available data fields\nprint(\"Columns in the shapefile:\", chicago.columns)\n\n# Check the data types of each column\nprint(\"Data types:\", chicago.dtypes)\n\n# View the spatial extent (bounding box) of the shapes\nprint(\"Bounding box:\", chicago.total_bounds)\n\n# Check the coordinate reference system (CRS)\nprint(\"CRS:\", chicago.crs)\n\nColumns in the shapefile: Index(['area', 'area_num_1', 'area_numbe', 'comarea', 'comarea_id',\n       'community', 'perimeter', 'shape_area', 'shape_len', 'geometry'],\n      dtype='object')\nData types: area           float64\narea_num_1      object\narea_numbe      object\ncomarea        float64\ncomarea_id     float64\ncommunity       object\nperimeter      float64\nshape_area     float64\nshape_len      float64\ngeometry      geometry\ndtype: object\nBounding box: [-87.94011408  41.64454312 -87.5241371   42.02303859]\nCRS: EPSG:4326\n\n\nTo enhance the geospatial plot, we’ll use the shapefile as a background to provide context for Chicago’s community areas. On top of that, we’ll layer points of interest, such as restaurants, and shops, to illustrate the city’s amenities. This approach will make the map more informative and visually engaging, with community boundaries as the foundation and key locations overlayed to highlight areas of interest.\nNext, we will add the Divvy bicycle stations on top of the chicago shapefile\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Dataset: Bicycle Sharing in Chicago\n\n\n\nDivvy is Chicagoland’s bike share system (in collaboration with Chicago Department of Transportation), with 6,000 bikes available at 570+ stations across Chicago and Evanston. Divvy provides residents and visitors with a convenient, fun and affordable transportation option for getting around and exploring Chicago.\nDivvy, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the region. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system. People use bike share to explore Chicago, commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements, and more.\nDivvy is available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year, and riders have access to all bikes and stations across the system.\nWe will be using divvy trips in the year of 2013\n\n# read the csv file'divvy_2013.csv' into pandas pandas dataframe\ndata = pd.read_csv('datasets/divvy_2013.csv')\ndata.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrip_id\nusertype\ngender\nstarttime\nstoptime\ntripduration\nfrom_station_id\nfrom_station_name\nlatitude_start\nlongitude_start\n...\ndewpoint\nhumidity\npressure\nvisibility\nwind_speed\nprecipitation\nevents\nrain\nconditions\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n0\n3940\nSubscriber\nMale\n2013-06-27 01:06:00\n2013-06-27 09:46:00\n31177\n91\nClinton St & Washington Blvd\n41.88338\n-87.641170\n...\n64.9\n96.0\n29.75\n7.0\n0.0\n-9999.0\npartlycloudy\n0\nScattered Clouds\n6\n\n\n1\n4095\nSubscriber\nMale\n2013-06-27 12:06:00\n2013-06-27 12:11:00\n301\n85\nMichigan Ave & Oak St\n41.90096\n-87.623777\n...\n69.1\n55.0\n29.75\n10.0\n13.8\n-9999.0\nmostlycloudy\n0\nMostly Cloudy\n6\n\n\n2\n4113\nSubscriber\nMale\n2013-06-27 11:09:00\n2013-06-27 11:11:00\n140\n88\nMay St & Randolph St\n41.88397\n-87.655688\n...\n70.0\n61.0\n29.75\n10.0\n10.4\n-9999.0\nmostlycloudy\n0\nMostly Cloudy\n6\n\n\n3\n4118\nCustomer\nNaN\n2013-06-27 12:11:00\n2013-06-27 12:16:00\n316\n85\nMichigan Ave & Oak St\n41.90096\n-87.623777\n...\n69.1\n55.0\n29.75\n10.0\n13.8\n-9999.0\nmostlycloudy\n0\nMostly Cloudy\n6\n\n\n4\n4119\nSubscriber\nMale\n2013-06-27 11:12:00\n2013-06-27 11:13:00\n87\n88\nMay St & Randolph St\n41.88397\n-87.655688\n...\n70.0\n61.0\n29.75\n10.0\n10.4\n-9999.0\nmostlycloudy\n0\nMostly Cloudy\n6\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 28 columns\n\n\n\nIn the Divvy dataset, each trip record includes the latitude and longitude coordinates of both the pickup and drop-off locations, which correspond to Divvy bike stations. These coordinates allow us to map the precise locations of each station, making it possible to visually display the network of Divvy stations across the city. By plotting these stations on a map, we can better understand the geographic distribution and accessibility of Divvy’s bike-sharing network.\nBelow are the basic data cleaning steps to extract the coordinates of the Divvy stations.\n\n# drop the duplicates in the column 'to_station_id', 'to_station_name', 'latitude_end', 'longitude_end'\n# data_station_same = data[['from_station_id', 'from_station_name', 'latitude_start', 'longitude_start', 'to_station_id', 'to_station_name', 'latitude_end', 'longitude_end']].drop_duplicates()\n# data_station_same.shape\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Adding the divvy station to the plot\nOnce the coordinates are prepared, we’ll add them as scatter plots on top of the Chicago shapefile\n\n# Adding the stations to the plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))\n\nchicago = gpd.read_file(r'datasets/chicago_boundaries\\geo_export_26bce2f2-c163-42a9-9329-9ca6e082c5e9.shp')\nchicago.plot(column='community', ax=ax, legend=True, legend_kwds={'ncol': 2, 'bbox_to_anchor': (2, 1)})\n\n# Plot the stations\nlonglat_df = data[[ 'latitude_start', 'longitude_start']].drop_duplicates()\n\nplt.scatter(longlat_df['longitude_start'], longlat_df['latitude_start'], s=10, alpha=0.5, color='black', marker='o')\n\n\n# Add title (optional)\nplt.title('Chicago Community Areas');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Change the chicago shapefile\nUsing a different Chicago shapefile from GeoDa is a great way to observe how geographic boundaries or data details may vary\n\nchicago = gpd.read_file(geodatasets.get_path(\"geoda.chicago_commpop\"))\n\n# Plot the data\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))\nchicago.boundary.plot(ax=ax)\nplt.scatter(data['longitude_start'], data['latitude_start'], s=10, alpha=0.5, color='black', marker='o')\nplt.title('Chicago Community Areas');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.5 Interactive Plotting\nAlongside static plots, geopandas can create interactive maps based on the folium library.\nCreating maps for interactive exploration mirrors the API of static plots in an explore() method of a GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame.\nHere’s an explanation of how explore() works and its key features:\nKey Features of explore():\n\nInteractive Map Display:\n\n\nWhen you call explore() on a Geodataframe (gdf), it launches an interactive map widget directly within your Jupyter notebook.\nThis map allows you to pan, zoom, and interact with the geometries (points, lines, polygons) in your Geodataframe.\n\n\nLayer Control:\n\n\nexplore() automatically adds the geometries from your Geodataframe as layers on the map.\nEach geometry type (points, lines, polygons) is displayed with appropriate styling and markers.\n\n\nTooltip Information:\n\n\nWhen you hover over a geometry in the map, explore() displays tooltip information that typically includes attribute data associated with that geometry.\nThis feature is useful for inspecting specific details or properties of individual features in your geospatial dataset.\n\n\nSearch and Filter:\n\n\nexplore() provides basic search and filter functionalities directly on the map.\nYou can search for specific attribute values or filter the displayed features based on attribute criteria defined in your Geodataframe.\n\n\nCustomization:\n\n\nAlthough explore() provides default styling and interaction behaviors, you can customize the map further using parameters or by manipulating the Geodataframe before calling explore().\n\n\n# use the geopandas explore default settings\nchicago = gpd.read_file(geodatasets.get_path(\"geoda.chicago_commpop\"))\n\nchicago.explore()\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nAdding the population layer\n\n# Customerize the explore settings\nchicago = gpd.read_file(geodatasets.get_path(\"geoda.chicago_commpop\"))\n\nm = chicago.explore(\n    column=\"POP2010\",  # make choropleth based on \"POP2010\" column\n    scheme=\"naturalbreaks\",  # use mapclassify's natural breaks scheme\n    legend=True,  # show legend\n    k=10,  # use 10 bins\n    tooltip=False,  # hide tooltip\n    popup=[\"POP2010\", \"POP2000\"],  # show popup (on-click)\n    legend_kwds=dict(colorbar=False),  # do not use colorbar\n    name=\"chicago\",  # name of the layer in the map\n)\n\nm\n\nc:\\Users\\lsi8012\\AppData\\Local\\anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\cluster\\_kmeans.py:1446: UserWarning: KMeans is known to have a memory leak on Windows with MKL, when there are less chunks than available threads.

We’ll compute Ben’s expenses for both stores - Target and Kroger\n\n\nCode\n%%time\n# using loops to calculate the total cost of food for Ben for all stores\ntotal_cost = {}\nfor store in price.columns:\n    total_cost[store] = 0\n    for food in food_qty.columns:\n        total_cost[store] += food_qty.loc['Ben',food]*price.loc[food,store]\ntotal_cost\n\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 1 ms\n\n\n{'Target': np.float64(50.0), 'Kroger': np.float64(49.0)}\n\n\n\n\nCode\n%%time\n# using numpy\ntotal_cost = np.dot(food_qty.loc['Ben',],price.loc[:,:])\ntotal_cost\n\n\nCPU times: total: 0 ns\nWall time: 0 ns\n\n\narray([50., 49.])\n\n\nBen will spend $50 if he goes to Target, and $49 if he goes to Kroger. Thus, he should choose Kroger.\nNow, let’s add the final layer of complication, and solve the problem. We’ll compute everyone’s expenses for both stores - Target and Kroger\n\n\nCode\n%%timeit\nstore_expense = pd.DataFrame(0.0, columns=price.columns, index = food_qty.index)\nfor person in store_expense.index:\n    for store in store_expense.columns:\n        for food in food_qty.columns:\n            store_expense.loc[person, store] += food_qty.loc[person, food]*price.loc[food, store]\n\nstore_expense\n\n\n1.51 ms ± 15.3 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n%%timeit\n# using matrix multiplication in numpy\npd.DataFrame(np.dot(food_qty.values, price.values), columns=price.columns, index=food_qty.index)\n\n\n11 μs ± 102 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)\n\n\nBased on the above table, Ben should go to Kroger, Barbara to Target and Beth can go to either store.\nAs the complexity of operations increases, the number of nested for-loops also grows, making the code more cumbersome and harder to manage. In contrast, the approach using NumPy arrays remains concise and straightforward, regardless of complexity. Vectorized computations are not only cleaner but also significantly faster, providing a more efficient solution.\n\n\n6.12.3 Practice exercise 3\nUse matrix multiplication to find the average IMDB rating and average Rotten tomatoes rating for each genre - comedy, action, drama and horror.

For example:\n\nImpact of Default Behavior: Dropping rows with even a single missing value reduced the number of rows from 155 to 42! This drastic reduction happens because, by default, dropna() removes any row with at least one missing value, keeping only rows that are completely complete.\nLoss of Non-Missing Data: Even though some columns may have very few missing values (e.g., at most 10), using dropna() without modification results in losing all non-missing data in affected rows. This is typically a poor choice, especially when valuable, non-missing data is removed unnecessarily.\n\nTo avoid losing too much data, you can adjust the behavior of dropna() using these parameters:\n\nhow Parameter\n\nControls the criteria for dropping rows or columns.\nhow='any' (default): Drops rows or columns if any values are missing.\n`how=‘all’: Drops rows or columns only if all values are missing\n\nthresh Parameter\n\nSets a minimum number of non-missing values required to retain the row or column.\nUseful when you want to keep rows or columns with substantial, but not complete, data.\n\n\nIf a few values of a column are missing, we can possibly estimate them using the rest of the data, so that we can (hopefully) maximize the information that can be extracted from the data. However, if most of the values of a column are missing, it may be harder to estimate its values.\nIn this dataset, we see that around 50% values of the contraception column is missing. Thus, we’ll drop the column as it may be hard to impute its values based on a relatively small number of non-missing values.\n\n#Deleting column with missing values in almost half of the observations\ngdp_missing_values_data.drop(['contraception'],axis=1,inplace=True)\ngdp_missing_values_data.shape\n\n(155, 11)\n\n\n\n\n10.1.3.2 Imputing Missing values\nThere are an unlimited number of ways to impute missing values. Some imputation methods are provided in the Pandas documentation.\nThe best way to impute them will depend on the problem:\n\nFor MCAR: Simple imputation is generally acceptable.\nFor MAR: Imputation should consider relationships with other variables, such as using conditional mean imputation.\nFor MNAR: Imputation requires careful analysis, and domain knowledge is essential to avoid bias.\n\nBelow are some of the most common methods. Recall that we randomly introduced missing values in gdp_missing_values_data, while the actual values are preserved in gdp_complete_data.\nWe will apply these methods to gdp_missing_values_data. To evaluate each method’s effectiveness in imputing missing values, we’ll compare the imputed gdpPerCapita values with the actual values and calculate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\nTo visualize the imputed vs actual values, let’s define a helper function\n\n#Index of rows with missing values for GDP per capita\nnull_ind_gdpPC = gdp_missing_values_data.index[gdp_missing_values_data.gdpPerCapita.isnull()]\n\n#Defining a function to plot the imputed values vs actual values \ndef plot_actual_vs_predicted(y):\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\n    plt.rc('xtick', labelsize=15) \n    plt.rc('ytick', labelsize=15) \n    x = gdp_complete_data.loc[null_ind_gdpPC,'gdpPerCapita']\n    # y = y.loc[null_ind_gdpPC,'gdpPerCapita']\n    plt.scatter(x,y.loc[null_ind_gdpPC,'gdpPerCapita'])\n    z=np.polyfit(x,y.loc[null_ind_gdpPC,'gdpPerCapita'],1)\n    p=np.poly1d(z)\n    plt.plot(x,x,color='orange')\n    plt.xlabel('Actual GDP per capita',fontsize=15)\n    plt.ylabel('Imputed GDP per capita',fontsize=15)\n    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n    plt.rc('axes', labelsize=10)  # Set all axis labels to fontsize 10\n    # plt.title('Actual vs Imputed values for GDP per capita',fontsize=20)\n    rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((y.loc[null_ind_gdpPC,'gdpPerCapita']-x)**2))\n    plt.text(10000, 50000, 'RMSE = %.2f'%rmse, fontsize=15)\n\n\n10.1.3.2.1 Mean/Median/Mode Imputation\nThis approach replaces missing values with the mean or median of the column.\nLet’s impute missing values in the column by substituting them with the average of the non-missing values. Imputing with the mean tends to minimize the sum of squared differences between actual values and imputed values, especially in cases where data is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). However, this might not hold true for other types of missing data, such as Missing at Random (MAR) or Missing Not at Random (MNAR).\nLet us impute missing values in the column as the average of the non-missing values of the column. The sum of squared differences between actual values and the imputed values is likely to be smaller if we impute using the mean. However, this may not be true in cases other than MCAR (Missing completely at random).\n\n# Extracting the columns with missing values\ncolumns_with_missing = [col for col in gdp_missing_values_data.columns if gdp_missing_values_data[col].isnull().any()]\ncolumns_with_missing\n\n['economicActivityFemale',\n 'lifeMale',\n 'infantMortality',\n 'gdpPerCapita',\n 'economicActivityMale',\n 'illiteracyMale',\n 'illiteracyFemale',\n 'lifeFemale']\n\n\n\n# Imputing missing values using the mean\ngdp_imputed_data_mean = gdp_missing_values_data[columns_with_missing].fillna(gdp_missing_values_data[columns_with_missing].mean())\n\n\nplot_actual_vs_predicted(gdp_imputed_data_mean)\n\n\n\n\nHere, since all columns with missing values are numerical, we could use the mean to impute these values. Using the mean is generally suitable only for numerical data, as it represents a central tendency specific to numbers. For categorical data, however, mean imputation would be inappropriate. Instead, the mode, which identifies the most frequently occurring value, is a more suitable choice for imputing missing values in categorical columns.\n\n\n10.1.3.2.2 Conditional Imputation: Use other related variables to predict missing values\nThere are three approaches within this category; please see the details below.\n\nImputing missing values based on correlated variables in the data\n\nIf a variable is highly correlated with another variable in the dataset, we can approximate its missing values using the trendline with the highly correlated variable.\nLet us visualize the distribution of GDP per capita for different continents.\n\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (12,6)\nsns.boxplot(x = 'continent',y='gdpPerCapita',data = gdp_missing_values_data);\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that there is a distinct difference between the GDPs per capita of some of the contents. Let us impute the missing GDP per capita of a country as the mean GDP per capita of the corresponding continent. This imputation should be better than imputing the missing GDP per capita as the mean of all the non-missing values, as the GDP per capita of a country is likely to be closer to the mean GDP per capita of the continent, rather the mean GDP per capita of the whole world.\n\n#Finding the mean GDP per capita of the continent - please defer the understanding of this code to chapter 9.\navg_gdpPerCapita = gdp_missing_values_data['gdpPerCapita'].groupby(gdp_missing_values_data['continent']).mean()\navg_gdpPerCapita\n\ncontinent\nAfrica            7638.178571\nAsia             25922.750000\nEurope           45455.303030\nNorth America    19625.210526\nOceania          15385.857143\nSouth America    15360.909091\nName: gdpPerCapita, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n#Creating a copy of missing data to impute missing values\ngdp_imputed_data_group_mean = gdp_missing_values_data.copy()\n\n\n#Replacing missing GDP per capita with the mean GDP per capita for the corresponding continent\n\ngdp_imputed_data_group_mean.gdpPerCapita = \\\ngdp_imputed_data_group_mean['gdpPerCapita'].fillna(gdp_imputed_data_group_mean['continent'].map(avg_gdpPerCapita))\nplot_actual_vs_predicted(gdp_imputed_data_group_mean)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the imputed values are closer to the actual values, and the RMSE has further reduced as expected.\nSuppose we wish to impute the missing values of each numeric column with the average of the non-missing values of the respective column corresponding to the continent of the observation. The above logic can be extended to each column as shown in the code below.\n\nall_columns_imputed_data = gdp_missing_values_data.iloc[:,[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]].apply(lambda x:\\\nx.fillna(gdp_imputed_data_group_mean['continent'].map(x.groupby(gdp_missing_values_data['continent']).mean())))\n\nUsing Regression\n\n#Let us identify the variable highly correlated with GDP per capita.\ngdp_missing_values_data.select_dtypes(include='number').corrwith(gdp_missing_values_data.gdpPerCapita)\n\neconomicActivityFemale    0.078332\nlifeMale                  0.579850\ninfantMortality          -0.572201\ngdpPerCapita              1.000000\neconomicActivityMale     -0.134108\nilliteracyMale           -0.479143\nilliteracyFemale         -0.448273\nlifeFemale                0.615954\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n#The variable *lifeFemale* has the strongest correlation with GDP per capita.

The neighbors to a data-point are identified based on their Euclidean distance to the point in terms of the standardized values of rest of the variables in the data.\nLet’s consider a toy example to understand missing value imputation by KNN. Suppose we have to impute missing values in a toy dataset, named as toy_data having 4 observations and 3 variables.\n\n#Toy example - A 4x3 array with missing values\nnan = np.nan\ntoy_data = np.array([[1, 2, nan], [3, 4, 3], [nan, 6, 5], [8, 8, 7]])\ntoy_data\n\narray([[ 1.,  2., nan],\n       [ 3.,  4.,  3.],\n       [nan,  6.,  5.],\n       [ 8.,  8.,  7.]])\n\n\nWe’ll use some functions from the sklearn library to perform the KNN imputation. It is much easier to directly use the algorithm from sklearn, instead of coding it from scratch.\n\n#Library to compute pair-wise Euclidean distance between all observations in the data\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\n#Library to impute missing values with the KNN algorithm\nfrom sklearn import impute\n\nWe’ll use the sklearn function nan_euclidean_distances() to compute the Euclidean distance between all pairs of observations in the data.\n\n#This is the distance matrix containing the distance of the ith observation from the jth observation at the (i,j) position in the matrix\nmetrics.pairwise.nan_euclidean_distances(toy_data,toy_data)\n\narray([[ 0.        ,  3.46410162,  6.92820323, 11.29158979],\n       [ 3.46410162,  0.        ,  3.46410162,  7.54983444],\n       [ 6.92820323,  3.46410162,  0.        ,  3.46410162],\n       [11.29158979,  7.54983444,  3.46410162,  0.        ]])\n\n\nNote that the size of the above matrix is 4x4. This is because the \\((i,j)^{th}\\) element of the matrix is the distance of the \\(i^{th}\\) observation from the \\(j^{th}\\) observation. The matrix is symmetric because the distance of \\(i^{th}\\) observation to the \\(j^{th}\\) observation is the same as the distance of the \\(j^{th}\\) observation to the \\(i^{th}\\) observation.\nWe’ll use the sklearn function KNNImputer() to impute the missing value of a column in toy_data as the mean of the values of the \\(K\\) nearest neighbors to the observation that have non-missing values for that column.\nLet us impute the missing values in toy_data using the values of \\(K=2\\) nearest neighbors from the corresponding observation.\n\n#imputing missing values with 2 nearest neighbors, where the neighbors have equal weights\n\n#Define an object of type KNNImputer\nimputer = impute.KNNImputer(n_neighbors=2)\n\n#Use the object method 'fit_transform' to impute missing values\nimputer.fit_transform(toy_data)\n\narray([[1. , 2. , 4. ],\n       [3. , 4. , 3. ],\n       [5.5, 6. , 5. ],\n       [8. , 8. , 7. ]])\n\n\nThe third observation was the closest to the \\(2nd\\) and \\(4th\\) observations based on the Euclidean distance matrix. Thus, the missing value in the \\(3rd\\) row of the toy_data has been imputed as the mean of the values in the \\(2nd\\) and \\(4th\\) observations for the corresponding column. Similarly, the \\(1st\\) observation is the closest to the \\(2nd\\) and \\(3rd\\) observations. Thus the missing value in the \\(1st\\) row of toy_data has been imputed as the mean of the values in the \\(1st\\) and \\(2nd\\) observations for the corresponding column.\nLet us use KNN to impute the missing values of gdpPerCapita in gdp_missing_values_data. We’ll use only the numeric columns of the data in imputing the missing values. Also, we’ll ignore contraception as it has a lot of missing values, and thus may not be useful.\n\n#Considering numeric columns in the data to use KNN\nnum_cols = list(range(0,1))+list(range(2,9))\nnum_cols\n\n[0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n\nBefore computing the pair-wise Euclidean distance of observations, we must standardize the data so that all columns are at the same scale. This will avoid columns with a higher magnitude of values having a higher weight in determining the Euclidean distance. Unless there is a reason to give a higher weight to a column, we assume all columns to have the same weight in the Euclidean distance computation.\nWe can use the code below to scale the data. However, after imputing the missing values, the data is to be scaled back to the original scale, so that each variable is in the same units as in the original dataset. However, if the code below is used, we’ll lose the orginal scale of each of the columns.\n\n#Scaling data to compute equally weighted distances from the 'k' nearest neighbors\nscaled_data = gdp_missing_values_data.iloc[:,num_cols].apply(lambda x:(x-x.min())/(x.max()-x.min()))\n\nTo alleviate the problem of losing the orignial scale of the data, we’ll use the MinMaxScaler object of the sklearn library. The object will store the original scale of the data, which will help transform the data back to the original scale once the missing values have been imputed in the standardized data.\n\n# Scaling data - using sklearn\n\n#Create an object of type MinMaxScaler\nscaler = sk.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()\n\n#Use the object method 'fit_transform' to scale the values to a standard uniform distribution\nscaled_data = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(gdp_missing_values_data.iloc[:,num_cols]))\n\n\n#Imputing missing values with KNNImputer\n\n#Define an object of type KNNImputer\nimputer = impute.KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3, weights=\"uniform\")\n\n#Use the object method 'fit_transform' to impute missing values\nimputed_arr = imputer.fit_transform(scaled_data)\n\n\n#Scaling back the scaled array to obtain the data at the original scale\n\n#Use the object method 'inverse_transform' to scale back the values to the original scale of the data\nunscaled_data = scaler.inverse_transform(imputed_arr)\n\n\n#Note the method imputes the missing value of all the columns\n#However, we are interested in imputing the missing values of only the 'gdpPerCapita' column\ngdp_imputed_data_knn = gdp_missing_values_data.copy()\ngdp_imputed_data_knn.loc[:,'gdpPerCapita'] = unscaled_data[:,3]\n\n\n#Visualizing the accuracy of missing value imputation with KNN\nplot_actual_vs_predicted(gdp_imputed_data_knn)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the RMSE is the lowest in this method. It is because this method imputes missing values as the average of the values of “similar” observations, which is smarter and more robust than the previous methods.\nWe chose \\(K=3\\) in the missing value imputation for GDP per capita. However, the value of \\(K\\) is typically chosen using a method known as cross validation. We’ll learn about cross-validation in the next course of the sequence.\n\n\n10.1.3.2.3 Forward Fill/Backward Fill\nTo fill missing values in a column by copying the value of the previous or next non-missing observation, we can use forward fill (propagating the last valid observation forward) or backward fill (propagating the next valid observation backward).\nBelow, we demonstrate forward fill. To perform backward fill instead, simply replace ffill with bfill\n\n#Filling missing values: Method 1- Naive way\ngdp_imputed_data_ffill = gdp_missing_values_data.ffill()\n\nLet us next check how good is this method in imputing missing values.\n\nplot_actual_vs_predicted(gdp_imputed_data_ffill)\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that the accuracy of imputation is poor as GDP per capita can vary a lot across countries, and the data is not sorted by GDP per capita. There is no reason why the GDP per capita of a country should be close to the GDP per capita of the country in the observation above it.\n\n#Checking if any missing values are remaining\ngdp_imputed_data_ffill.isnull().sum()\n\neconomicActivityFemale    0\ncountry                   0\nlifeMale                  0\ninfantMortality           0\ngdpPerCapita              0\neconomicActivityMale      0\nilliteracyMale            1\nilliteracyFemale          0\nlifeFemale                0\ngeographic_location       0\ncontinent                 0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nAfter imputing missing values, note there is still one missing value for illiteracyMale. Can you guess why one missing value remained?"

    "section": "10.3 Data binning",
    "text": "10.3 Data binning\nData binning is a powerful technique in data analysis where continuous numerical data is grouped into discrete intervals or “bins.” Imagine it as sorting items into distinct categories or “buckets” based on their values, making it easier to observe trends, patterns, and groupings within large datasets. We encounter binning in everyday life without even realizing it.\nFor example, consider age groups: instead of listing every individual age, we often refer to broader categories like “under 20,” “20-30,” “30-40,” or “40 and over.” This binning approach helps simplify data interpretation and comparison across different age groups. Another common example is tax brackets. Tax rates are often applied to ranges of income, like “up to $11,000,” “$11,001 to $44,725,” and so forth. Here, income values are grouped into bins to determine applicable tax rates, making complex tax data easier to manage and understand.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n10.3.1 Key reasons for binning:\n\nBetter intepretation of data\n\nMaking better recommendations\n\nSmooth data, reduce noise\n\nExamples:\nBinning to better interpret data\n\nThe number of flu cases everyday may be binned to seasons such as fall, spring, winter and summer, to understand the effect of season on flu.\n\nBinning to make recommendations:\n\nA doctor may like to group patient age into bins. Grouping patient ages into categories such as Age &lt;=12, 12&lt;Age&lt;=18, 18&lt;Age&lt;=65, Age&gt;65 may help recommend the kind/doses of covid vaccine a patient needs.\nA credit card company may want to bin customers based on their spend, as “High spenders”, “Medium spenders” and “Low spenders”. Binning will help them design customized marketing campaigns for each bin, thereby increasing customer response (or revenue). On the other hand, they use the same campaign for customers withing the same bin, thus minimizng marketing costs.\n\nBinning to smooth data, and reduce noise\n\nA sales company may want to bin their total sales to a weekly / monthly / yearly level to reduce the noise in day-to-day sales.\n\nUsing our college dataset, let’s apply binning to better interpret the relationship between instructional expenditure per student (Expend) and graduation rate (Grad.Rate) for U.S. universities, and make relevant recommendations\nHere is the previous scatterplot of ‘Grad.Rate’ vs ‘Expend’ with a trendline.\n\n# scatter plot of Expend vs Grad.Rate\nax=sns.regplot(data = college, x = \"Expend\", y = \"Grad.Rate\",scatter_kws={\"color\": \"orange\"}, line_kws={\"color\": \"blue\"})\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\nax.set_xlabel('Expenditure per student')\nax.set_ylabel('Graduation rate')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe trendline indicates a positive correlation between Expend and Grad.Rate.

Let’s explore this approach next.\n\n\n10.3.2.2 Binning with equal sized bins\nLet us bin the variable Expend such that each bin consists of the same number of observations.\nWe’ll use the Pandas function qcut() to make equal-sized bins (in contrast to equal-width bins in the previous section).\n\n#Using the Pandas function qcut() to create bins with the same number of observations\nBinned_expend = pd.qcut(college['Expend'],3,retbins = True)\ncollege['Expend_bin'] = Binned_expend[0]\n\nEach bin has the same number of observations with qcut():\n\ncollege['Expend_bin'].value_counts()\n\nExpend_bin\n(3185.999, 7334.333]    259\n(7334.333, 9682.333]    259\n(9682.333, 56233.0]     259\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nLet us visualize the Expend bins over the distribution of the Expend variable.\n\n#Visualizing the bins for instructional expediture on a student\nsns.set(font_scale=1.25)\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (9,6)\nax=sns.histplot(data = college, x= 'Expend')\nplt.vlines(Binned_expend[1], 0,100,color='red')\nplt.xlabel('Expenditure per student');\nplt.ylabel('Graduation rate');\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n\n\n\n\nNote that the bin-widths have been adjusted to have the same number of observations in each bin. The bins are narrower in domains of high density, and wider in domains of sparse density.\nLet us again make the barplot visualizing the average graduate rate with level of instructional expenditure per student.\n\ncollege['Expend_bin'] = pd.qcut(college['Expend'],3,labels = ['Low expend','Med expend','High expend'])\na=sns.barplot(x = 'Expend_bin', y = 'Grad.Rate', data = college)\n\n\n\n\nNow we see the same trend that we saw in the scatterplot, but without the noise. We have smoothed the data. Note that making equal-sized bins helps reduce the effect of outliers in the overall trend.\nSuppose this analysis was done to provide recommendations to universities for increasing their graduation rate. With binning, we can can provide one recommendation to ‘Low expend’ universities, and another one to ‘Med expend’ universities. For example, the recommendations can be:\n\n‘Low expend’ universities can expect an increase of 9 percentage points in Grad.Rate, if they migrate to the ‘Med expend’ category.\n‘Med expend’ universities can expect an increase of 7 percentage points in Grad.Rate, if they migrate to the ‘High expend’ category.\n\nThe numbers in the above recommendations are based on the table below.\n\ncollege.groupby(college.Expend_bin, observed=False)['Grad.Rate'].mean()\n\nExpend_bin\nLow expend     57.343629\nMed expend     66.057915\nHigh expend    72.988417\nName: Grad.Rate, dtype: float64\n\n\nWe can also provide recommendations based on the confidence intervals of the mean graduation rate (Grad.Rate). The confidence intervals, calculated below, are derived using a method known as bootstrapping. For a detailed explanation of bootstrapping, please refer to this article on Wikipedia.\n\n# Bootstrapping to find 95% confidence intervals of Graduation Rate of US universities based on average expenditure per student\nconfidence_intervals = {}\n\n# Loop through each expenditure bin\nfor expend_bin, data_sub in college.groupby('Expend_bin', observed=False):\n    # Generate bootstrap samples for the graduation rate\n    samples = np.random.choice(data_sub['Grad.Rate'], size=(10000, len(data_sub)), replace=True)\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of each sample\n    sample_means = samples.mean(axis=1)\n    \n    # Calculate the 95% confidence interval\n    lower_bound = np.percentile(sample_means, 2.5)\n    upper_bound = np.percentile(sample_means, 97.5)\n    \n    # Store the result in the dictionary\n    confidence_intervals[expend_bin] = (round(lower_bound, 2), round(upper_bound, 2))\n\n# Print the results\nfor expend_bin, ci in confidence_intervals.items():\n    print(f\"95% Confidence interval of Grad.Rate for {expend_bin} universities = [{ci[0]}, {ci[1]}]\")\n\n95% Confidence interval of Grad.Rate for Low expend universities = [55.36, 59.36]\n95% Confidence interval of Grad.Rate for Med expend universities = [64.15, 67.95]\n95% Confidence interval of Grad.Rate for High expend universities = [71.03, 74.92]\n\n\nApart from equal-width and equal-sized bins, custom bins can be created using the bins argument. Suppose, bins are to be created for Expend with cutoffs \\(\\$10,000, \\$20,000, \\$30,000... \\$60,000\\). Then, we can use the bins argument as in the code below:\n\n\n10.3.2.3 Binning with custom bins\n\nBinned_expend = pd.cut(college.Expend,bins = list(range(0,70000,10000)),retbins=True)\n\n\n#Visualizing the bins for instructional expediture on a student\nax=sns.histplot(data = college, x= 'Expend')\nplt.vlines(Binned_expend[1], 0,100,color='red')\nplt.xlabel('Expenditure per student');\nplt.ylabel('Graduation rate');\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s create a custom bin with unequal sizes and widths.\n\n# Create bins and labels\nbins = [college['Expend'].min(), 10000, 40000, college['Expend'].max()]\nlabels = ['Low Expenditure', 'Medium Expenditure', 'High Expenditure']\n\n# Binning the 'Expend' column\ncollege['Expend_Binned'] = pd.cut(college['Expend'], bins=bins, labels=labels)\n\n# Visualizing the bins using a histogram\nax = sns.histplot(data=college, x='Expend', kde=False)\n\n# Add vertical lines for the bin edges (the bin edges are the values in 'bins')\nfor bin_edge in bins[1:-1]:  # skip the first and last bins since they are the edges\n    plt.vlines(bin_edge, 0, ax.get_ylim()[1], color='red')\n\n# Add labels and formatting\nplt.xlabel('Expenditure per student')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nAs custom bin-cutoffs can be specified with the cut() function, custom bin quantiles can be specified with the qcut() function."

    "text": "10.2 Outlier detection and handling\nAn outlier is an observation that is significantly different from the rest of the data. Outlier detection and handling are important in data science because outliers can significantly impact the quality, accuracy, and interpretability of data analysis and model performance. Here are the main reasons why it’s crucial to address outliers:\n\nPreventing Skewed Results: Outliers can distort statistical measures, such as the mean and standard deviation, leading to misleading interpretations of the data. For example, a few extreme values can inflate the mean, making the data seem larger than it is in reality.\nImproving Model Accuracy: Many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to outliers and can perform poorly if outliers are present. For instance, in linear regression, outliers can disproportionately affect the model by pulling the line of best fit toward them, reducing predictive accuracy.\nEnhancing Robustness of Models: Identifying and handling outliers can make models more robust and stable. By minimizing the influence of extreme values, models become less sensitive to noise, which improves generalization and reduces overfitting.\n\n\n10.2.1 Outlier detection\nOutlier detection is crucial for identifying unusual values in your data that may need to be investigated, removed, or transformed. Here are several popular methods for detecting outliers:\nWe will use College.csv that contains information about US universities as our dataset in this section. The description of variables of the dataset can be found on page 65 of this book.\n\n# Load the College dataset\ncollege = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/College.csv')\ncollege.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\nPrivate\nApps\nAccept\nEnroll\nTop10perc\nTop25perc\nF.Undergrad\nP.Undergrad\nOutstate\nRoom.Board\nBooks\nPersonal\nPhD\nTerminal\nS.F.Ratio\nperc.alumni\nExpend\nGrad.Rate\n\n\n\n\n0\nAbilene Christian University\nYes\n1660\n1232\n721\n23\n52\n2885\n537\n7440\n3300\n450\n2200\n70\n78\n18.1\n12\n7041\n60\n\n\n1\nAdelphi University\nYes\n2186\n1924\n512\n16\n29\n2683\n1227\n12280\n6450\n750\n1500\n29\n30\n12.2\n16\n10527\n56\n\n\n2\nAdrian College\nYes\n1428\n1097\n336\n22\n50\n1036\n99\n11250\n3750\n400\n1165\n53\n66\n12.9\n30\n8735\n54\n\n\n3\nAgnes Scott College\nYes\n417\n349\n137\n60\n89\n510\n63\n12960\n5450\n450\n875\n92\n97\n7.7\n37\n19016\n59\n\n\n4\nAlaska Pacific University\nYes\n193\n146\n55\n16\n44\n249\n869\n7560\n4120\n800\n1500\n76\n72\n11.9\n2\n10922\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.1.1 Visualization Methods\n\nBox Plot: A box plot is a quick and visual way to detect outliers, where points outside the “whiskers” are considered outliers.\n\nLet us visualize outliers in average instructional expenditure per student given by the variable Expend.\n\nax=college.boxplot(column = 'Expend')\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n\n\n\n\nThere are several outliers (shown as circles in the above boxplot), which correspond to high values of average instructional expenditure per student.\n\nHistogram: Histograms can reveal unusual values as isolated bars, helping to identify outliers in a single feature.\n\n\n# create a histogram of expend\ncollege['Expend'].plot(kind='hist', edgecolor='black', bins=20)\nplt.xlabel('Expenditure')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Histogram of Expenditure')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plot: A scatter plot can reveal outliers, especially in two-dimensional data. Outliers will often appear as points separated from the main cluster.\n\nLet’s make a scatterplot of ‘Grad.Rate’ vs ‘Expend’ with a trendline, to visualize potential outliers\n\nsns.set(font_scale=1.5)\nax=sns.regplot(data = college, x = \"Expend\", y = \"Grad.Rate\",scatter_kws={\"color\": \"orange\"}, line_kws={\"color\": \"blue\"})\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\nax.set_xlabel('Expenditure per student')\nax.set_ylabel('Graduation rate')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe trendline indicates a positive correlation between Expend and Grad.Rate. However, there seems to be a lot of noise and presence of outliers in the data.\n\n\n10.2.1.2 Statistical Methods\nVisualization helps us identify potential outliers. To address them effectively, we need to extract these outlier instances using a defined threshold. Two commonly used statistical methods for this purpose are the Z-Score method and the Interquartile Range (IQR) (Tukey’s fences).\n\n10.2.1.2.1 Z-Score (Standard Score)\nCalculates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Commonly, data points with a Z-score greater than 3 (or less than -3) are considered outliers.\n\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# Calculate Z-scores and identify outliers\ncollege['z_score'] = stats.zscore(college['Expend'])\ncollege['is_z_score_outlier'] = college['z_score'].abs() &gt; 3\n\n# Filter to show only the outliers\nz_score_outliers = college[college['is_z_score_outlier']]\nprint(z_score_outliers.shape)\nz_score_outliers.head()\n\n(16, 21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\nPrivate\nApps\nAccept\nEnroll\nTop10perc\nTop25perc\nF.Undergrad\nP.Undergrad\nOutstate\n...\nBooks\nPersonal\nPhD\nTerminal\nS.F.Ratio\nperc.alumni\nExpend\nGrad.Rate\nz_score\nis_z_score_outlier\n\n\n\n\n20\nAntioch University\nYes\n713\n661\n252\n25\n44\n712\n23\n15476\n...\n400\n1100\n69\n82\n11.3\n35\n42926\n48\n6.374709\nTrue\n\n\n144\nColumbia University\nYes\n6756\n1930\n871\n78\n96\n3376\n55\n18624\n...\n550\n300\n97\n98\n5.9\n21\n30639\n99\n4.020159\nTrue\n\n\n158\nDartmouth College\nYes\n8587\n2273\n1087\n87\n99\n3918\n32\n19545\n...\n550\n1100\n95\n99\n4.7\n49\n29619\n98\n3.824698\nTrue\n\n\n174\nDuke University\nYes\n13789\n3893\n1583\n90\n98\n6188\n53\n18590\n...\n625\n1162\n95\n96\n5.0\n44\n27206\n97\n3.362296\nTrue\n\n\n191\nEmory University\nYes\n8506\n4168\n1236\n76\n97\n5544\n192\n17600\n...\n600\n870\n97\n98\n5.0\n28\n28457\n96\n3.602024\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 21 columns\n\n\n\nBoxplot identifies outliers based on the Tukey’s fences criterion:\n\n\n10.2.1.2.2 IQR method (Tukey’s fences)\nJohn Tukey proposed that observations outside the range \\([Q1 - 1.5(Q3-Q1), Q3+1.5(Q3-Q1)]\\) are outliers, where \\(Q1\\) and \\(Q3\\) are the lower \\((25\\%)\\) and upper \\((75\\%)\\) quartiles respectively.

Below are some commonly used approaches:\n\nRemoving Outliers: Discarding extreme values if they are likely due to errors or are irrelevant for the analysis.\nWinsorizing: Capping/flooring outliers to a specific percentile to reduce their influence without removing them completely.\nReplacing with the median: Replacing outlier values with the median of the remaining data. The median is less affected by extreme values than the mean, making it an ideal choice for imputation when dealing with outliers\nTransforming Data: Applying transformations (e.g., log, square root) to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\n\ndef method_removal():\n    \"\"\"Method 1: Remove outliers\"\"\"\n    data_cleaned = college[~college['is_outlier']]['Expend']\n    return data_cleaned\n\n\ndef method_capping():\n    \"\"\"Method 2: Capping (Winsorization)\"\"\"\n    data_capped = college['Expend'].copy()\n    data_capped[data_capped &lt; lower_bound] = lower_bound\n    data_capped[data_capped &gt; upper_bound] = upper_bound\n    return data_capped\n\n\ndef method_mean_replacement():\n    \"\"\"Method 3: Replace with median\"\"\"\n    data_median = college['Expend'].copy()\n    median_value = college[~college['is_outlier']]['Expend'].median()\n    data_median[college['is_outlier']] = median_value\n    return data_median\n\n\ndef method_log_transformation():\n    \"\"\"Method 4: Log transformation\"\"\"\n    data_log = np.log1p(college['Expend'])\n    return data_log\n\nYour Practice: Try each method and compare their results to see how they differ in handling outliers.\nIn real-world applications, handling outliers should be approached on a case-by-case basis. However, here are some general recommendations:\nRecommendations for Different Scenarios:\n\nData Removal:\n\nUse when: You have a large dataset and can afford to lose data\nPros: Simple, removes all outlier influence\nCons: Loss of data, potential loss of important information\n\nCapping (Winsorization):\n\nUse when: You want to preserve data count while limiting extreme values\nPros: Preserves data size, reduces impact of outliers\nCons: Artificial boundary creation, potential loss of genuine extreme events\n\nMedian Replacement:\n\nUse when: The data is normally distributed, and outliers are verified as errors or anomalies not representing true values\nPros: Maintains data size, simple to implement\nCons: Reduces variance, may not represent the true distribution\n\nLog Transformation:\n\nUse when: Data has a right-skewed distribution, and you want to reduce the impact of large outliers.\nPros: Reduces skewness, minimizes the effect of extreme values, can make data more normal-like.\nCons: Only applicable to positive values, may not be effective for extremely high outliers."

Each observation has been assigned to a specific group of the column(s) used to group the data. However, note that the dataset is not physically split into different DataFrames. For example, in the above case, each observation is assigned to a particular group depending on the value of the continent for that observation. However, all the observations are still in the same DataFrame data.\n\n\n11.1.2 Attributes and methods of the GroupBy object\n\n11.1.2.1 keys\nThe object(s) grouping the data are called key(s).

    "text": "11.2 Common Aggregation Functions\nAggregation functions are essential for summarizing and analyzing data in pandas. These functions allow you to compute summary statistics for your data, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.\nBelow are some of the most commonly used aggregation functions when working with grouped data in pandas:\n\nmean() – Calculates the average value of the group.\nsum() – Computes the total value by summing all elements in the group.\nmin() – Finds the minimum value in the group.\nmax() – Finds the maximum value in the group.\ncount() – Returns the number of occurrences or entries in the group.\nmedian() – Finds the middle value in the sorted group.\nstd() – Calculates the standard deviation, measuring the spread or variation in the values of the group.\n\nEach of these functions can help summarize and provide insights into different aspects of the grouped data.\nConsider the life expectancy dataset, let’s find the mean life expectancy, population and GDP per capita for each country during the period of 1952 -2007.\nNext, we’ll find the mean statistics for each group with the mean() method. The method will be applied on all columns of the DataFrame and all groups.\n\n#Grouping the observations by 'country'\ngrouped_country = gdp_lifeExp_data.drop (['continent', 'year'], axis = 1).groupby('country')\n\n#Finding the mean stastistic of all columns of the DataFrame and all groups\ngrouped_country.mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlifeExp\npop\ngdpPercap\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n37.478833\n1.582372e+07\n802.674598\n\n\nAlbania\n68.432917\n2.580249e+06\n3255.366633\n\n\nAlgeria\n59.030167\n1.987541e+07\n4426.025973\n\n\nAngola\n37.883500\n7.309390e+06\n3607.100529\n\n\nArgentina\n69.060417\n2.860224e+07\n8955.553783\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nVietnam\n57.479500\n5.456857e+07\n1017.712615\n\n\nWest Bank and Gaza\n60.328667\n1.848606e+06\n3759.996781\n\n\nYemen, Rep.\n46.780417\n1.084319e+07\n1569.274672\n\n\nZambia\n45.996333\n6.353805e+06\n1358.199409\n\n\nZimbabwe\n52.663167\n7.641966e+06\n635.858042\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll find the standard deviation statistics for each group with the std() method.\n\ngrouped_country.std()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlifeExp\npop\ngdpPercap\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n5.098646\n7.114583e+06\n108.202929\n\n\nAlbania\n6.322911\n8.285855e+05\n1192.351513\n\n\nAlgeria\n10.340069\n8.613355e+06\n1310.337656\n\n\nAngola\n4.005276\n2.672281e+06\n1165.900251\n\n\nArgentina\n4.186470\n7.546609e+06\n1862.583151\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nVietnam\n12.172331\n2.052585e+07\n567.482251\n\n\nWest Bank and Gaza\n11.000069\n1.023057e+06\n1716.840614\n\n\nYemen, Rep.\n11.019302\n5.590408e+06\n609.939160\n\n\nZambia\n4.453246\n3.096949e+06\n247.494984\n\n\nZimbabwe\n7.071816\n3.376895e+06\n133.689213\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can compute other statistical metrics.\n\n11.2.1 Multiple aggregations and Custom aggregation using agg()\n\n11.2.1.1 Multiple aggregations\nDirectly applying the aggregate methods of the GroupBy object such as mean, count, etc., lets us apply only one function at a time.

This approach enables us to analyze data at a finer granularity, revealing insights that might be missed with single-column grouping alone.\n\n11.3.1 Basic Syntax for Grouping by Multiple Columns\nUse groupby() with a list of column names to group data by multiple columns.\n\nDataFrame.groupby(by=[\"col1\", \"col2\"])\n\nConsider the life expectancy dataset, we can group by both country and continent to analyze gdpPercap, lifeExp, and pop trends for each country within each continent, providing a more comprehensive view of the data.\n\n#Grouping by multiple columns\ngrouped_continent_contry = gdp_lifeExp_data.groupby(['continent', 'country'])[ \"lifeExp\"].agg(['mean', 'std', 'max', 'min']).sort_values(by = 'mean', ascending = False)\n\n\ngrouped_continent_contry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nstd\nmax\nmin\n\n\ncontinent\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\nIceland\n76.511417\n3.026593\n81.757\n72.490\n\n\nSweden\n76.177000\n3.003990\n80.884\n71.860\n\n\nNorway\n75.843000\n2.423994\n80.196\n72.670\n\n\nNetherlands\n75.648500\n2.486363\n79.762\n72.130\n\n\nSwitzerland\n75.565083\n4.011572\n81.701\n69.620\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nAfrica\nMozambique\n40.379500\n4.599184\n46.344\n31.286\n\n\nGuinea-Bissau\n39.210250\n4.937369\n46.388\n32.500\n\n\nAngola\n37.883500\n4.005276\n42.731\n30.015\n\n\nAsia\nAfghanistan\n37.478833\n5.098646\n43.828\n28.801\n\n\nAfrica\nSierra Leone\n36.769167\n3.937828\n42.568\n30.331\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Understanding Hierarchical (Multi-Level) Indexing\n\nGrouping by multiple columns creates a hierarchical index (also called a multi-level index).\nThis index allows each level (e.g., continent, country) to act as an independent category that can be accessed individually.\n\nIn the above output, continent and country form a two-level hierarchical index, allowing us to drill down from continent-level to country-level summaries.\n\ngrouped_continent_contry.index.nlevels\n\n2\n\n\n\n# get the first level of the index\ngrouped_continent_contry.index.levels[0]\n\nIndex(['Africa', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Oceania'], dtype='object', name='continent')\n\n\n\n# get the second level of the index\ngrouped_continent_contry.index.levels[1]\n\nIndex(['Afghanistan', 'Albania', 'Algeria', 'Angola', 'Argentina', 'Australia',\n       'Austria', 'Bahrain', 'Bangladesh', 'Belgium',\n       ...\n       'Uganda', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Uruguay', 'Venezuela',\n       'Vietnam', 'West Bank and Gaza', 'Yemen, Rep.', 'Zambia', 'Zimbabwe'],\n      dtype='object', name='country', length=142)\n\n\n\n\n11.3.3 Subsetting Data in a Hierarchical Index\ngrouped_continent_country is still a DataFrame with hierarchical indexing.

    "text": "11.4 Advanced Operations within groups: apply(), transform(), and filter()\n\n11.4.1 Using apply() on groups\nThe apply() function applies a custom function to each group, allowing for flexible operations. The function can return either a scalar, Series, or DataFrame.\nExample: Consider the life expectancy dataset, find the top 3 life expectancy values for each continent\nWe’ll first define a function that sorts a dataset by decreasing life expectancy and returns the top 3 rows. Then, we’ll apply this function on each group using the apply() method of the GroupBy object.\n\n# Define a function to get the top 3 rows based on life expectancy for each group\ndef top_3_life_expectancy(group):\n    return group.nlargest(3, 'lifeExp')\n\n\n#Defining the groups in the data\ngrouped_gdpcapital_data = gdp_lifeExp_data.groupby('continent')\n\nNow we’ll use the apply() method to apply the top_3_life_expectancy() function on each group of the object grouped_gdpcapital_data.\n\n# Apply the function to each continent group\ntop_life_expectancy = gdp_lifeExp_data.groupby('continent')[['continent', 'country', 'year', 'lifeExp', 'gdpPercap']].apply(top_3_life_expectancy).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Display the result\ntop_life_expectancy.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinent\ncountry\nyear\nlifeExp\ngdpPercap\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfrica\nReunion\n2007\n76.442\n7670.122558\n\n\n1\nAfrica\nReunion\n2002\n75.744\n6316.165200\n\n\n2\nAfrica\nReunion\n1997\n74.772\n6071.941411\n\n\n3\nAmericas\nCanada\n2007\n80.653\n36319.235010\n\n\n4\nAmericas\nCanada\n2002\n79.770\n33328.965070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top_3_life_expectancy() function is applied to each group, and the results are concatenated internally with the concat() function. The output therefore has a hierarchical index whose outer level indices are the group keys.\nWe can also use a lambda function instead of separately defining the function top_3_life_expectancy():\n\n\n# Use a lambda function to get the top 3 life expectancy values for each continent\ntop_life_expectancy = (\n    gdp_lifeExp_data\n    .groupby('continent')[['continent', 'country', 'year', 'lifeExp', 'gdpPercap']]  # Avoid adding group labels in the index\n    .apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(3, 'lifeExp'))\n    .reset_index(drop=True)\n)\n\n# Display the result\ntop_life_expectancy.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinent\ncountry\nyear\nlifeExp\ngdpPercap\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfrica\nReunion\n2007\n76.442\n7670.122558\n\n\n1\nAfrica\nReunion\n2002\n75.744\n6316.165200\n\n\n2\nAfrica\nReunion\n1997\n74.772\n6071.941411\n\n\n3\nAmericas\nCanada\n2007\n80.653\n36319.235010\n\n\n4\nAmericas\nCanada\n2002\n79.770\n33328.965070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Using transform() on Groups\nThe transform() function applies a function to each group and returns a Series aligned with the original DataFrame’s index. This makes it suitable for adding or modifying columns based on group-level calculations.\nRecall that in the data cleaning and preparation chapter, we imputed missing values based on correlated variables in the dataset.\nIn the example provided, some countries had missing values for GDP per capita. To handle this, we imputed the missing GDP per capita for each country using the average GDP per capita of its corresponding continent.\nNow, we’ll explore an alternative approach using groupby() and transform() to perform this imputation.\nLet us read the datasets and the function that makes a visualization to compare the imputed values with the actual values.\n\n#Importing data with missing values\ngdp_missing_data = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/GDP_missing_data.csv')\n\n#Importing data with all values\ngdp_complete_data = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/GDP_complete_data.csv')\n\n\n#Index of rows with missing values for GDP per capita\nnull_ind_gdpPC = gdp_missing_data.index[gdp_missing_data.gdpPerCapita.isnull()]\n\n#Defining a function to plot the imputed values vs actual values \ndef plot_actual_vs_predicted():\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\n    plt.rc('xtick', labelsize=15) \n    plt.rc('ytick', labelsize=15) \n    x = gdp_complete_data.loc[null_ind_gdpPC,'gdpPerCapita']\n    y = gdp_imputed_data.loc[null_ind_gdpPC,'gdpPerCapita']\n    plt.scatter(x,y)\n    z=np.polyfit(x,y,1)\n    p=np.poly1d(z)\n    plt.plot(x,x,color='orange')\n    plt.xlabel('Actual GDP per capita',fontsize=20)\n    plt.ylabel('Imputed GDP per capita',fontsize=20)\n    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n    rmse = np.sqrt(((x-y).pow(2)).mean())\n    print(\"RMSE=\",rmse)\n\nApproach 1: Using the approach we used in the previous chapter\n\n#Finding the mean GDP per capita of the continent\navg_gdpPerCapita = gdp_missing_data['gdpPerCapita'].groupby(gdp_missing_data['continent']).mean()\n\n#Creating a copy of missing data to impute missing values\ngdp_imputed_data = gdp_missing_data.copy()\n\n#Replacing missing GDP per capita with the mean GDP per capita for the corresponding continent\nfor cont in avg_gdpPerCapita.index:\n    gdp_imputed_data.loc[(gdp_imputed_data.continent==cont) & (gdp_imputed_data.gdpPerCapita.isnull()),\n                     'gdpPerCapita']=avg_gdpPerCapita[cont]\nplot_actual_vs_predicted()\n\nRMSE= 25473.20645170116\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach 2: Using the groupby() and transform() methods.\nThe transform() function is a powerful tool for filling missing values in grouped data. It allows us to apply a function across each group and align the result back to the original DataFrame, making it perfect for filling missing values based on group statistics.\nIn this example, we use transform() to impute missing values in the gdpPerCapita column by filling them with the mean gdpPerCapita of each continent:\n\n#Creating a copy of missing data to impute missing values\ngdp_imputed_data = gdp_missing_data.copy()\n\n#Grouping data by continent\ngrouped = gdp_missing_data.groupby('continent')\n\n#Imputing missing values with the mean GDP per capita of the continent\ngdp_imputed_data['gdpPerCapita'] = grouped['gdpPerCapita'].transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.mean()))\n\nplot_actual_vs_predicted()\n\nRMSE= 25473.20645170116\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the transform() function, missing values in gdpPerCapita for each group are filled with the group’s mean gdpPerCapita. This approach is not only more convenient to write but also faster compared to using for loops. While a for loop imputes missing values one group at a time, transform() performs built-in operations (like mean, sum, etc.) in a way that is optimized internally, making it more efficient.\nLet’s use apply() instead of transform() with groupby()\n\n#Creating a copy of missing data to impute missing values\ngdp_imputed_data = gdp_missing_data.copy()\n\n#Grouping data by continent\ngrouped = gdp_missing_data.groupby('continent')\n\n#Applying the lambda function on the 'gdpPerCapita' column of the groups\ngdp_imputed_data['gdpPerCapita'] = grouped['gdpPerCapita'].apply(lambda x: x.fillna(x.mean()))\n\nplot_actual_vs_predicted()\n\nTypeError: incompatible index of inserted column with frame index\n\n\nWhy we ran into this error? and apply() doesn’t work?\nHere’s a deeper look at why apply() doesn’t work as expected here:\n\n11.4.2.1 Behavior of groupby().apply() vs. groupby().transform()\n\ngroupby().apply(): This method applies a function to each group and returns the result with a hierarchical (multi-level) index by default. This hierarchical index can make it difficult to align the result back to a single column in the original DataFrame.\ngroupby().transform(): In contrast, transform() is specifically designed to apply a function to each group and return a Series that is aligned with the original DataFrame’s index. This alignment makes it directly compatible for assignment to a new or existing column in the original DataFrame.\n\n\n\n11.4.2.2 Why transform() Works for Imputation\nWhen using transform() to fill missing values, it applies the function (e.g., fillna(x.mean())) based on each group’s statistics, such as the mean, while keeping the result aligned with the original DataFrame’s index. This allows for smooth assignment to a column in the DataFrame without any index mismatch issues.\nAdditionally, transform() applies the function to each element in a group independently and returns a result that has the same shape as the original data, making it ideal for adding or modifying columns.\n\n\n\n11.4.3 Using filter() on Groups\nThe filter() function filters entire groups based on a condition. It evaluates each group and keeps only those that meet the specified criteria.\nExample: Keep only the countries where the mean life expectancy is greater than 70\n\n# keep only the continent where the mean life expectancy is greater than 74\ngdp_lifeExp_data.groupby('continent').filter(lambda x: x['lifeExp'].mean() &gt; 74)['continent'].unique()\n\narray(['Oceania'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\n# keep only the country where the mean life expectancy is greater than 74\ngdp_lifeExp_data.groupby('country').filter(lambda x: x['lifeExp'].mean() &gt; 74)['country'].unique()\n\narray(['Australia', 'Canada', 'Denmark', 'France', 'Iceland', 'Italy',\n       'Japan', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Spain', 'Sweden', 'Switzerland'],\n      dtype=object)\n\n\nUsing .nunique() get the number of countries that satisfy this condition\n\ngdp_lifeExp_data.groupby('country').filter(lambda x: x['lifeExp'].mean() &gt; 74)['country'].nunique()\n\n12"

These functions allow you to compute summary statistics for your data, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.\nBelow are some of the most commonly used aggregation functions when working with grouped data in pandas:\n\nmean() – Calculates the average value of the group.\nsum() – Computes the total value by summing all elements in the group.\nmin() – Finds the minimum value in the group.\nmax() – Finds the maximum value in the group.\ncount() – Returns the number of occurrences or entries in the group.\nmedian() – Finds the middle value in the sorted group.\nstd() – Calculates the standard deviation, measuring the spread or variation in the values of the group.\n\nEach of these functions can help summarize and provide insights into different aspects of the grouped data.\nConsider the life expectancy dataset, let’s find the mean life expectancy, population and GDP per capita for each country during the period of 1952 -2007.\nNext, we’ll find the mean statistics for each group with the mean() method. The method will be applied on all columns of the DataFrame and all groups.\n\n#Grouping the observations by 'country'\ngrouped_country = gdp_lifeExp_data.drop (['continent', 'year'], axis = 1).groupby('country')\n\n#Finding the mean stastistic of all columns of the DataFrame and all groups\ngrouped_country.mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlifeExp\npop\ngdpPercap\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n37.478833\n1.582372e+07\n802.674598\n\n\nAlbania\n68.432917\n2.580249e+06\n3255.366633\n\n\nAlgeria\n59.030167\n1.987541e+07\n4426.025973\n\n\nAngola\n37.883500\n7.309390e+06\n3607.100529\n\n\nArgentina\n69.060417\n2.860224e+07\n8955.553783\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nVietnam\n57.479500\n5.456857e+07\n1017.712615\n\n\nWest Bank and Gaza\n60.328667\n1.848606e+06\n3759.996781\n\n\nYemen, Rep.\n46.780417\n1.084319e+07\n1569.274672\n\n\nZambia\n45.996333\n6.353805e+06\n1358.199409\n\n\nZimbabwe\n52.663167\n7.641966e+06\n635.858042\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll find the standard deviation statistics for each group with the std() method.\n\ngrouped_country.std()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlifeExp\npop\ngdpPercap\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n5.098646\n7.114583e+06\n108.202929\n\n\nAlbania\n6.322911\n8.285855e+05\n1192.351513\n\n\nAlgeria\n10.340069\n8.613355e+06\n1310.337656\n\n\nAngola\n4.005276\n2.672281e+06\n1165.900251\n\n\nArgentina\n4.186470\n7.546609e+06\n1862.583151\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nVietnam\n12.172331\n2.052585e+07\n567.482251\n\n\nWest Bank and Gaza\n11.000069\n1.023057e+06\n1716.840614\n\n\nYemen, Rep.\n11.019302\n5.590408e+06\n609.939160\n\n\nZambia\n4.453246\n3.096949e+06\n247.494984\n\n\nZimbabwe\n7.071816\n3.376895e+06\n133.689213\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can compute other statistical metrics.\n\n\n11.2.2 Multiple aggregations and Custom aggregation using agg()\n\n11.2.2.1 Multiple aggregations\nDirectly applying the aggregate methods of the GroupBy object such as mean, count, etc., lets us apply only one function at a time. Also, we may wish to apply an aggregate function of our own, which is not there in the set of methods of the GroupBy object, such as the range of values of a column.\nThe agg() function of a GroupBy

The datasets consist of housing features, like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc., and the price. Both datasets are exactly the same, except that Housing_missing_price.csv has some missing values of price. In this question, you will try different methods to impute the missing values of house price in the file Housing_missing_price.csv. You will use the prices in Housing_complete.csv to check the accuracy of your imputation.\nNote that you cannot use Housing_complete.csv to impute missing price in any of the questions. Housing_complete.csv is just to check the accuracy of your imputation, after you have done the imputation. Before imputing the missing price, assume you do not have Housing_complete.csv.\n\nE.1.1 Number of missing values\nHow many values of price are missing in Housing_missing_price.csv?\n(3 points)\n\n\nE.1.2 Indices of missing values\nFind the row labels, where the price is missing.

However, before implementing the algorithm, find the optimal value of \\(K\\), using \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation. Use all the variables in housing_dummy.\nNote that you cannot use Housing_complete.csv to find the optimal \\(K\\).\nFollow the \\(k\\)-fold cross validation procedure below to find the optimal \\(K\\), i.e., the optimal number of nearest neighbors to consider when imputing missing values:\n\nRemove observations with missing price from housing_dummy. Let us call the resulting DataFrame as housing_missing_removed.\nSplit housing_missing_removed into \\(k\\)-folds. Take \\(k=10\\). Each fold will have one-tenth of the observations of housing_missing_removed.\nIterate over the \\(K^{th}\\) potential value of \\(K\\), where \\(K \\in \\{1,2,...,50\\}\\).\nA. Iterate over the \\(i^{th}\\) fold, where \\(i \\in \\{1,2,...,10\\}\\)\nI. Assume that the all the price values of the \\(i^{th}\\) fold are missing. Impute the value of price for an observation in the \\(i^{th}\\) fold as the mean price of the \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors to the observation, where the neighbors are from among the observations in the remaining 9 folds.\n\nCompute the RMSE (Root mean squared error) for the \\(i^{th}\\) fold. Let us denote the RMSE for \\(i^{th}\\) fold, and considering \\(K\\) nearest neighbors as \\(RMSE_{iK}\\).\n\nB. Find the average of the 10 RMSEs obtained in 3(A). Let us denote it as \\(RMSE_K\\), i.e., RMSE for a given value of \\(K\\). Then, \\[RMSE_K = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{i=1}^{i=10} RMSE_{iK}\\]\nThe optimal value of \\(K\\) is the one for which \\(RMSE_K\\) is the minimum, i.e., \\[K_{optimal}=\\underset{K \\in \\{1,...,50\\}}{\\operatorname{\\ argmin}} RMSE_K\\]\n\nAssumption to make it a bit simpler: Ideally you should split the dataset randomly into \\(k\\)-folds. However, to make it simpler, you may assume that the data is already shuffled, and you may take the first \\(1/10^{th}\\) observations to be in the \\(1^{st}\\) fold, the next \\(1/10^{th}\\) to be in the \\(2^{nd}\\) fold and so on.\nMore explanation about \\(k\\)-fold cross validation and the optimal \\(K\\):\nYou need to impute the missing price using the KNN (K-nearest neighbor) algorithm. However, before implementing the algorithm, find the optimal value of \\(K\\), using \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation. This is an optimization method used for more advanced Machine Learning methods, such as KNN. In KNN, the number of neighbors, \\(K\\), is called a hyperparameter, which cannot be optimized with a mathematical method. Therefore, it needs a more coding-based optimization method called cross-validation.\nThe idea of cross-validation is to split the dataset into subsets, called folds. After that a range of \\(K\\) values is picked. For each \\(K\\) value in the range, the KNN imputer is created and evaluated on each fold separately, returning an RMSE value for each fold. The average value of these RMSE values is the cross-validation RMSE value of that \\(K\\) value. Cross-validation is a robust method to find the best \\(K\\) in the KNN algorithm for the data at hand because it evaluates different parts of the data separately and takes the average of all results. It is called \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation, with \\(k\\) as the number of folds we want to use, usually 3, 5 or 10. In this problem, we will use 10-fold cross-validation. Note that you need nested for loops to iterate over both each \\(K\\) value and each fold for this algorithm.\n\n\nE.1.8.2 Implementing KNN with optimal \\(K\\)\nUsing the optimal value of \\(K = K_{optimal}\\) obtained in the previous question, impute the missing values of price in housing_missing_price. Use all the variables in housing_dummy for implementing the KNN algorithm. Plot the imputed price vs true price (from Housing_complete.csv) and print the RMSE (Root mean squared error). This is to be done only for the imputed values of price.\nAnswer check: The RMSE obtained with KNN should be lower than that obtained with any of the earlier methods. If not, then there may be some mistake in your KNN implementation.\n\n\n\nE.1.9 Ultra-bonus question\n(30 points)\nDevelop an algorithm to impute the missing price, such that it reduces the imputation RMSE to below $650k. Plot the imputed price vs true price (from Housing_complete.csv) and print the RMSE (Root mean squared error). This is to be done only for the imputed values of price.\nNote that we have not attempted to solve this question yet. We are not sure if a solution exists. However, if you find a solution, you will get 30 points.\nHint: In the bonus question, all variables were given equal weights when imputing missing values with KNN. However, shouldn’t some variables be given higher weight than others?\nIf you think you are successful, email your solution to krish@northwestern.edu for grading."

    "section": "12.1 Data Reshaping",
    "text": "12.1 Data Reshaping\nData reshaping involves altering the structure of the data to suit the requirements of the analysis or modeling process. This is often needed when the data is in a format that is difficult to analyze or when it needs to be organized in a specific way.\n\n12.1.1 Why Data Reshaping is Important:\n\nImproves Data Organization: Raw data may be in a long format, where each observation is recorded on a separate row, or it may be in a wide format, where the same variable is spread across multiple columns. Reshaping allows you to reorganize the data into a format that is more suitable for analysis, such as turning multiple columns into a single column (melting) or aggregating rows into summary statistics (pivoting).\nFacilitates Analysis: Some analysis techniques require specific data formats. For example, many machine learning algorithms require data in a matrix form, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature. Reshaping helps to convert data into this format.\nSimplifies Visualization: Visualizing data is easier when it is in the right shape. For instance, plotting categorical data across time is easier when the data is in a tidy format, rather than having multiple variables spread across columns.\nEfficient Grouping and Aggregation: In some cases, you may want to group data by certain categories or time periods, and reshaping can help aggregate data effectively for summarization.\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Wide vs. Long Data Format in Data Reshaping\n\nWide Format: Each variable in its own column; each row represents a unit, and data for multiple variables is spread across columns.\nLong Format: Variables are stacked into one column per variable, with additional columns used to indicate time, categories, or other distinctions, leading to a greater number of rows.\n\n\nTo reshape between these two formats, you can use pandas functions such as pivot_table(), melt(), stack(), and unstack(). Let’s next take a look at each of these methods one by one.\nThroughout this section, we will continue using the gdp_lifeExpectancy.csv dataset.

The pivot_table() function is used to reshape data by specifying columns for the index, columns, and values.\n\n12.1.3.1 Pivoting a single column\nConsider the life expectancy dataset.

It is worth investigating these countries to identify factors associated with the decrease.\nAnother way to visualize a pivot table is by using a heatmap, which represents the 2D table as a matrix of colors, making it easier to interpret patterns and trends.\n\n# Plotting a heatmap to visualize the life expectancy of all countries in all years, figure size is set to 15x10\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\nplt.title(\"Life expectancy of all countries in all years\")\nsns.heatmap(gdp_lifeExp_data_pivot);\n\n\n\n\nCommon Aggregation Functions in pivot_table()\nYou can use various aggregation functions within pivot_table() to summarize data:\n\nmean – Calculates the average of values within each group.\nsum – Computes the total of values within each group.\ncount – Counts the number of non-null entries within each group.\nmin and max – Finds the minimum and maximum values within each group.\n\nWe can also define our own custom aggregation function and pass it to the aggfunc parameter of the pivot_table() function\nFor Example: Find the \\(90^{th}\\) percentile of life expectancy for each country and year combination\n\npd.pivot_table(data = gdp_lifeExp_data, values = 'lifeExp',index = 'country', columns ='year',aggfunc = lambda x:np.percentile(x,90))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n1952\n1957\n1962\n1967\n1972\n1977\n1982\n1987\n1992\n1997\n2002\n2007\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n28.801\n30.332\n31.997\n34.020\n36.088\n38.438\n39.854\n40.822\n41.674\n41.763\n42.129\n43.828\n\n\nAlbania\n55.230\n59.280\n64.820\n66.220\n67.690\n68.930\n70.420\n72.000\n71.581\n72.950\n75.651\n76.423\n\n\nAlgeria\n43.077\n45.685\n48.303\n51.407\n54.518\n58.014\n61.368\n65.799\n67.744\n69.152\n70.994\n72.301\n\n\nAngola\n30.015\n31.999\n34.000\n35.985\n37.928\n39.483\n39.942\n39.906\n40.647\n40.963\n41.003\n42.731\n\n\nArgentina\n62.485\n64.399\n65.142\n65.634\n67.065\n68.481\n69.942\n70.774\n71.868\n73.275\n74.340\n75.320\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nVietnam\n40.412\n42.887\n45.363\n47.838\n50.254\n55.764\n58.816\n62.820\n67.662\n70.672\n73.017\n74.249\n\n\nWest Bank and Gaza\n43.160\n45.671\n48.127\n51.631\n56.532\n60.765\n64.406\n67.046\n69.718\n71.096\n72.370\n73.422\n\n\nYemen, Rep.\n32.548\n33.970\n35.180\n36.984\n39.848\n44.175\n49.113\n52.922\n55.599\n58.020\n60.308\n62.698\n\n\nZambia\n42.038\n44.077\n46.023\n47.768\n50.107\n51.386\n51.821\n50.821\n46.100\n40.238\n39.193\n42.384\n\n\nZimbabwe\n48.451\n50.469\n52.358\n53.995\n55.635\n57.674\n60.363\n62.351\n60.377\n46.809\n39.989\n43.487\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 12 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.4 Melting “wide” to “long” using melt()\nMelting is the inverse of pivoting.

These operations are particularly useful when working with multi-level index or multi-level columns, where the data is structured in a hierarchical format.\n\nstack(): Converts columns into rows, which means it “stacks” the data into a long format.\nunstack(): Converts rows into columns, reversing the effect of stack().\n\nLet’s use the GDP per capita dataset and create a DataFrame with a multi-level index (e.g., continent, country) and multi-level columns (e.g., lifeExp , gdpPercap, and pop).\n\n# calculate the average and standard deviation of life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for countries across the years.\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data = gdp_lifeExp_data.groupby(['continent', 'country'])[['lifeExp', 'pop', 'gdpPercap']].agg(['mean', 'std'])\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlifeExp\npop\ngdpPercap\n\n\n\n\nmean\nstd\nmean\nstd\nmean\nstd\n\n\ncontinent\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\nAlgeria\n59.030167\n10.340069\n1.987541e+07\n8.613355e+06\n4426.025973\n1310.337656\n\n\nAngola\n37.883500\n4.005276\n7.309390e+06\n2.672281e+06\n3607.100529\n1165.900251\n\n\nBenin\n48.779917\n6.128681\n4.017497e+06\n2.105002e+06\n1155.395107\n159.741306\n\n\nBotswana\n54.597500\n5.929476\n9.711862e+05\n4.710965e+05\n5031.503557\n4178.136987\n\n\nBurkina Faso\n44.694000\n6.845792\n7.548677e+06\n3.247808e+06\n843.990665\n183.430087\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nEurope\nSwitzerland\n75.565083\n4.011572\n6.384293e+06\n8.582009e+05\n27074.334405\n6886.463308\n\n\nTurkey\n59.696417\n9.030591\n4.590901e+07\n1.667768e+07\n4469.453380\n2049.665102\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n73.922583\n3.378943\n5.608780e+07\n3.174339e+06\n19380.472986\n7388.189399\n\n\nOceania\nAustralia\n74.662917\n4.147774\n1.464931e+07\n3.915203e+06\n19980.595634\n7815.405220\n\n\nNew Zealand\n73.989500\n3.559724\n3.100032e+06\n6.547108e+05\n17262.622813\n4409.009167\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 6 columns\n\n\n\nThe resulting DataFrame has two levels of index and two levels of columns, as shown below:\n\n# check the level of row and column index\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.index.nlevels\n\n2\n\n\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.columns.nlevels\n\n2\n\n\nif you want to see the data along with the index and columns (in a more accessible way), you can directly print the .index and .columns attributes.\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.index\n\nMultiIndex([( 'Africa',                  'Algeria'),\n            ( 'Africa',                   'Angola'),\n            ( 'Africa',                    'Benin'),\n            ( 'Africa',                 'Botswana'),\n            ( 'Africa',             'Burkina Faso'),\n            ( 'Africa',                  'Burundi'),\n            ( 'Africa',                 'Cameroon'),\n            ( 'Africa', 'Central African Republic'),\n            ( 'Africa',                     'Chad'),\n            ( 'Africa',                  'Comoros'),\n            ...\n            ( 'Europe',                   'Serbia'),\n            ( 'Europe',          'Slovak Republic'),\n            ( 'Europe',                 'Slovenia'),\n            ( 'Europe',                    'Spain'),\n            ( 'Europe',                   'Sweden'),\n            ( 'Europe',              'Switzerland'),\n            ( 'Europe',                   'Turkey'),\n            ( 'Europe',           'United Kingdom'),\n            ('Oceania',                'Australia'),\n            ('Oceania',              'New Zealand')],\n           names=['continent', 'country'], length=142)\n\n\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.columns\n\nMultiIndex([(  'lifeExp', 'mean'),\n            (  'lifeExp',  'std'),\n            (      'pop', 'mean'),\n            (      'pop',  'std'),\n            ('gdpPercap', 'mean'),\n            ('gdpPercap',  'std')],\n           )\n\n\nAs seen, the index and columns each contain tuples.

The level parameter helps identify which part of the multi-level structure you’re working with.\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.index.get_level_values(0)\n\nIndex(['Africa', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'Africa',\n       'Africa', 'Africa', 'Africa',\n       ...\n       'Europe', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'Europe',\n       'Europe', 'Oceania', 'Oceania'],\n      dtype='object', name='continent', length=142)\n\n\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.index.get_level_values(1)\n\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.columns.get_level_values(0)\n\nIndex(['lifeExp', 'lifeExp', 'pop', 'pop', 'gdpPercap', 'gdpPercap'], dtype='object')\n\n\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.columns.get_level_values(1)\n\nIndex(['mean', 'std', 'mean', 'std', 'mean', 'std'], dtype='object')\n\n\n\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.columns.get_level_values(-1)\n\nIndex(['mean', 'std', 'mean', 'std', 'mean', 'std'], dtype='object')\n\n\nAs seen above, the outermost level corresponds to level=0, and it increases as we move inward to the inner levels. The innermost level can be referred to as -1.\nNow, let’s use the level number in the droplevel() method to see how it works. The syntax for this method is as follows:\nDataFrame.droplevel(level, axis=0)\n\n# drop the first level of row index\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.droplevel(0, axis=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlifeExp\npop\ngdpPercap\n\n\n\nmean\nstd\nmean\nstd\nmean\nstd\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria\n59.030167\n10.340069\n1.987541e+07\n8.613355e+06\n4426.025973\n1310.337656\n\n\nAngola\n37.883500\n4.005276\n7.309390e+06\n2.672281e+06\n3607.100529\n1165.900251\n\n\nBenin\n48.779917\n6.128681\n4.017497e+06\n2.105002e+06\n1155.395107\n159.741306\n\n\nBotswana\n54.597500\n5.929476\n9.711862e+05\n4.710965e+05\n5031.503557\n4178.136987\n\n\nBurkina Faso\n44.694000\n6.845792\n7.548677e+06\n3.247808e+06\n843.990665\n183.430087\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nSwitzerland\n75.565083\n4.011572\n6.384293e+06\n8.582009e+05\n27074.334405\n6886.463308\n\n\nTurkey\n59.696417\n9.030591\n4.590901e+07\n1.667768e+07\n4469.453380\n2049.665102\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n73.922583\n3.378943\n5.608780e+07\n3.174339e+06\n19380.472986\n7388.189399\n\n\nAustralia\n74.662917\n4.147774\n1.464931e+07\n3.915203e+06\n19980.595634\n7815.405220\n\n\nNew Zealand\n73.989500\n3.559724\n3.100032e+06\n6.547108e+05\n17262.622813\n4409.009167\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 6 columns\n\n\n\n\n# drop the first level of column index\ngdp_lifeExp_multilevel_data.droplevel(0, axis=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nstd\nmean\nstd\nmean\nstd\n\n\ncontinent\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\nAlgeria\n59.030167\n10.340069\n1.987541e+07\n8.613355e+06\n4426.025973\n1310.337656\n\n\nAngola\n37.883500\n4.005276\n7.309390e+06\n2.672281e+06\n3607.100529\n1165.900251\n\n\nBenin\n48.779917\n6.128681\n4.017497e+06\n2.105002e+06\n1155.395107\n159.741306\n\n\nBotswana\n54.597500\n5.929476\n9.711862e+05\n4.710965e+05\n5031.503557\n4178.136987\n\n\nBurkina Faso\n44.694000\n6.845792\n7.548677e+06\n3.247808e+06\n843.990665\n183.430087\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nEurope\nSwitzerland\n75.565083\n4.011572\n6.384293e+06\n8.582009e+05\n27074.334405\n6886.463308\n\n\nTurkey\n59.696417\n9.030591\n4.590901e+07\n1.667768e+07\n4469.453380\n2049.665102\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n73.922583\n3.378943\n5.608780e+07\n3.174339e+06\n19380.472986\n7388.189399\n\n\nOceania\nAustralia\n74.662917\n4.147774\n1.464931e+07\n3.915203e+06\n19980.595634\n7815.405220\n\n\nNew Zealand\n73.989500\n3.559724\n3.100032e+06\n6.547108e+05\n17262.622813\n4409.009167\n\n\n\n\n142 rows × 6 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.5.2 Stacking (Columns to Rows ): stack()\nThe stack() function pivots the columns into rows.

    "text": "12.2 Data Enriching\nData enriching involves enhancing your existing dataset by adding additional data, often from external sources, to make your dataset more insightful.\n\nThere are 3 common methods for data enriching:\n\nMerging using merge(): Combining datasets based on a common key.\nJoining using join(): Using indices to combine data.\nConcatenation using concat(): Stacking DataFrames vertically or horizontally.\n\nLet’s first load the existing data\n\ndf_existing = pd.read_csv('./datasets/LOTR.csv')\nprint(df_existing.shape)\ndf_existing.head()\n\n(4, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nSkills\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n\n\n2\n1003\nGandalf\nSpells\n\n\n3\n1004\nPippin\nFireworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s next load the external data we want to combine to the existing data\n\ndf_external = pd.read_csv(\"./datasets/LOTR 2.csv\")\nprint(df_external.shape)\ndf_external.head()\n\n(5, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\n50\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\n39\n\n\n2\n1006\nLegolas\n2931\n\n\n3\n1007\nElrond\n6520\n\n\n4\n1008\nBarromir\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.1 Combining based on common keys: merge()\n\ndf_enriched_merge = pd.merge(df_existing, df_external)\nprint(df_enriched_merge.shape)\ndf_enriched_merge.head()\n\n(2, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nSkills\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n50\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also do this way\n\ndf_enriched_merge = df_existing.merge(df_external)\nprint(df_enriched_merge.shape)\ndf_enriched_merge.head()\n\n(2, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nSkills\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n50\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the merge() function in pandas performs an inner join, which combines two DataFrames based on the common keys shared by both. Only the rows with matching keys in both DataFrames are retained in the result.\nThis behavior can be observed in the following code:\n\ndf_enriched_merge = pd.merge(df_existing, df_external, how='inner')\nprint(df_enriched_merge.shape)\ndf_enriched_merge.head()\n\n(2, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nSkills\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n50\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you may use inner join? You should use inner join when you cannot carry out the analysis unless the observation corresponding to the key column(s) is present in both the tables.\nExample: Suppose you wish to analyze the association between vaccinations and covid infection rate based on country-level data. In one of the datasets, you have the infection rate for each country, while in the other one you have the number of vaccinations in each country. The countries which have either the vaccination or the infection rate missing, cannot help analyze the association. In such as case you may be interested only in countries that have values for both the variables. Thus, you will use inner join to discard the countries with either value missing.\nIn merge(), the how parameter specifies the type of merge to be performed, the default option is inner, it could also be left, right, and outer.\n\nThese join types give you flexibility in how you want to merge and combine data from different sources.\nLet’s see how each of these works using our dataframes defined above\nLeft Join\n\nReturns all rows from the left DataFrame and the matching rows from the right DataFrame.\nMissing values (NaN) are introduced for non-matching keys from the right DataFrame.\n\n\ndf_merge_lft = pd.merge(df_existing, df_external, how='left')\nprint(df_merge_lft.shape)\ndf_merge_lft.head()\n\n(4, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nSkills\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n50.0\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n39.0\n\n\n2\n1003\nGandalf\nSpells\nNaN\n\n\n3\n1004\nPippin\nFireworks\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you may use left join? You should use left join when the primary variable(s) of interest are present in the one of the datasets, and whose missing values cannot be imputed. The variable(s) in the other dataset may not be as important or it may be possible to reasonably impute their values, if missing corresponding to the observation in the primary dataset.\nExamples:\n\nSuppose you wish to analyze the association between the covid infection rate and the government effectiveness score (a metric used to determine the effectiveness of the government in implementing policies, upholding law and order etc.) based on the data of all countries. Let us say that one of the datasets contains the covid infection rate, while the other one contains the government effectiveness score for each country. If the infection rate for a country is missing, it might be hard to impute. However, the government effectiveness score may be easier to impute based on GDP per capita, crime rate etc. - information that is easily available online. In such a case, you may wish to use a left join where you keep all the countries for which the infection rate is known.\nSuppose you wish to analyze the association between demographics such as age, income etc. and the amount of credit card spend. Let us say one of the datasets contains the demographic information of each customer, while the other one contains the credit card spend for the customers who made at least one purchase. In such as case, you may want to do a left join as customers not making any purchase might be absent in the card spend data. Their spend can be imputed as zero after merging the datasets.\n\nRight join\n\nReturns all rows from the right DataFrame and the matching rows from the left DataFrame.\nMissing values (NaN) are introduced for non-matching keys from the left DataFrame.\n\n\ndf_merge_right = pd.merge(df_existing, df_external, how='right')\nprint(df_merge_right.shape)\ndf_merge_right.head()\n\n(5, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nSkills\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n50\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n39\n\n\n2\n1006\nLegolas\nNaN\n2931\n\n\n3\n1007\nElrond\nNaN\n6520\n\n\n4\n1008\nBarromir\nNaN\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you may use right join? You can always use a left join instead of a right join. Their purpose is the same.\n\n12.2.1.1 outer join\n\nReturns all rows from both DataFrames, with NaN values where no match is found.\n\n\ndf_merge_outer = pd.merge(df_existing, df_external, how='outer')\nprint(df_merge_outer.shape)\ndf_merge_outer\n\n(7, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID\nFirstName\nSkills\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n50.0\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n39.0\n\n\n2\n1003\nGandalf\nSpells\nNaN\n\n\n3\n1004\nPippin\nFireworks\nNaN\n\n\n4\n1006\nLegolas\nNaN\n2931.0\n\n\n5\n1007\nElrond\nNaN\n6520.0\n\n\n6\n1008\nBarromir\nNaN\n51.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you may use outer join? You should use an outer join when you cannot afford to lose data present in either of the tables. All the other joins may result in loss of data.\nExample: Suppose I took two course surveys for this course. If I need to analyze student sentiment during the course, I will take an outer join of both the surveys. Assume that each survey is a dataset, where each row corresponds to a unique student. Even if a student has answered one of the two surverys, it will be indicative of the sentiment, and will be useful to keep in the merged dataset.\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Combining based on Indices: join()\nUnlike merge(), join() in pandas combines data based on the index. When using join(), you must specify the suffixes parameter if there are overlapping column names, as it does not have default values. You can refer to the official function definition here: pandas.DataFrame.join.\n\ndf_enriched_join = df_existing.join(df_external)\nprint(df_enriched_join.shape)\ndf_enriched_join.head()\n\nValueError: columns overlap but no suffix specified: Index(['FellowshipID', 'FirstName'], dtype='object')\n\n\nLet’s set the suffix to fix this issue\n\ndf_enriched_join = df_existing.join(df_external, lsuffix = '_existing',rsuffix = '_external')\nprint(df_enriched_join.shape)\ndf_enriched_join.head()\n\n(4, 6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellowshipID_existing\nFirstName_existing\nSkills\nFellowshipID_external\nFirstName_external\nAge\n\n\n\n\n0\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\n1001\nFrodo\n50\n\n\n1\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\n1002\nSamwise\n39\n\n\n2\n1003\nGandalf\nSpells\n1006\nLegolas\n2931\n\n\n3\n1004\nPippin\nFireworks\n1007\nElrond\n6520\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be observed, join() merges DataFrames using their index and performs a left join.\nNow, let’s set the “FellowshipID” column as the index in both DataFrames and see what happens.\n\n# set the index of the dataframes as the \"FellowshipID\" column\ndf_existing.set_index('FellowshipID', inplace=True)\ndf_external.set_index('FellowshipID', inplace=True)\n\n\n# join the two dataframes\ndf_enriched_join = df_existing.join(df_external, lsuffix = '_existing',rsuffix = '_external')\nprint(df_enriched_join.shape)\ndf_enriched_join\n\n(4, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstName_existing\nSkills\nFirstName_external\nAge\n\n\nFellowshipID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\nFrodo\n50.0\n\n\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\nSamwise\n39.0\n\n\n1003\nGandalf\nSpells\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1004\nPippin\nFireworks\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, df_enriched_join will contain all rows from df_existing and the corresponding matching rows from df_external, with NaN values for non-matching entries.\nSimilar to merge(), you can change the type of join in join() by explicitly specifying the how parameter. However, this explanation will be skipped here, as the different join types have already been covered in the merge() section above.\n\n\n12.2.3 Stacking vertically or horizontally: concat()\nconcat() is used in pandas to concatenate DataFrames along a specified axis, either rows or columns. Similar to concat() in NumPy, it defaults to concatenating along the rows.\n\n# let's concatenate the two dataframes using default setting\ndf_concat = pd.concat([df_existing, df_external])\nprint(df_concat.shape)\ndf_concat\n\n(9, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstName\nSkills\nAge\n\n\nFellowshipID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\nNaN\n\n\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\nNaN\n\n\n1003\nGandalf\nSpells\nNaN\n\n\n1004\nPippin\nFireworks\nNaN\n\n\n1001\nFrodo\nNaN\n50.0\n\n\n1002\nSamwise\nNaN\n39.0\n\n\n1006\nLegolas\nNaN\n2931.0\n\n\n1007\nElrond\nNaN\n6520.0\n\n\n1008\nBarromir\nNaN\n51.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Concatenating along columns (horizontal)\ndf_concat_columns = pd.concat([df_existing, df_external], axis=1)\nprint(df_concat_columns.shape)\ndf_concat_columns\n\n(7, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstName\nSkills\nFirstName\nAge\n\n\nFellowshipID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1001\nFrodo\nHiding\nFrodo\n50.0\n\n\n1002\nSamwise\nGardening\nSamwise\n39.0\n\n\n1003\nGandalf\nSpells\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1004\nPippin\nFireworks\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1006\nNaN\nNaN\nLegolas\n2931.0\n\n\n1007\nNaN\nNaN\nElrond\n6520.0\n\n\n1008\nNaN\nNaN\nBarromir\n51.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.4 Missing values after data enriching\nUsing either of the approaches mentioned above may introduce missing values for unmatched entries. Handling these missing values is crucial for maintaining the quality and integrity of your dataset after merging or joining DataFrames. It is important to choose a method that best fits your data and analysis goals, and to document your decisions regarding missing value handling for transparency in your analysis.\nQuestion: Read the documentations of the Pandas DataFrame methods merge() and concat(), and identify the differences. Mention examples when you can use (i) either, (ii) only concat(), (iii) only merge()\nSolution:\n\nIf we need to merge datasets using row indices, we can use either function.\nIf we need to stack datasets one on top of the other, we can only use concat()\nIf we need to merge datasets using overlapping columns we can only use merge()\n\nFor a comprehensive user guide, please refer to the official documentation."

Use the drop() method with the columns, level and inplace arguments. Print the first 2 rows of the updated DataFrame. If the first row of the DataFrame has missing values for all columns, drop that row as well.\n\n\n12.3.2.2 \nDrop the inner level of column labels. Use the droplevel() method. Print the first 2 rows of the updated DataFrame.\n\n\n12.3.2.3 \nConvert the columns consisting of GDP per capita by IMF, World Bank, and the United Nations to numeric. Apply a lambda function on these columns to convert them to numeric. Print the number of missing values in each column of the updated DataFrame.\nNote: Do not apply the function 3 times. Apply it once on a DataFrame consisting of these 3 columns.\n\n\n12.3.2.4 \nApply the lambda function below on all the column names of the dataset obtained in the previous question to clean the column names.\nimport re\ncolumn_name_cleaner = lambda x:re.split(r'\\[|/', x)[0]\nNote: You will need to edit the parameter of the function, i.e., x in the above function to make sure it is applied on column names and not columns.\nPrint the first 2 rows of the updated DataFrame.\n\n\n12.3.2.5 \nCreate a new column GDP_per_capita that copies the GDP per capita values of the United Nations. If the GDP per capita is missing in the United Nations column, then copy it from the World Bank column. If the GDP per capita is missing both in the United Nations and the World Bank columns, then copy it from the IMF column.\nPrint the number of missing values in the GDP_per_capita column.\n\n\n12.3.2.6 \nDrop all the columns except Country and GDP_per_capita. Print the first 2 rows of the updated DataFrame.\n\n\n12.3.2.7 \nThe country names contain some special characters (characters other than letters) and need to be cleaned.

Save the cleaned dataset as gdp_per_capita_data. Print the first 2 rows of the updated DataFrame.\n\n\n12.3.2.8 Preparing population data\nRead the population data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations).\n\nDrop all columns except Country, UN Continental Region[1], and Population (1 July 2023).\nDrop the first row since it is the total population in the world\n\n\n\n12.3.2.9 \nApply the lambda function below on all the column names of the dataset obtained in the previous question to clean the column names.\nimport re\ncolumn_name_cleaner = lambda x:re.split(r'\\[|/|\\(| ', x.name)[0]\nNote: You will need to edit the parameter of the function, i.e., x in the above function to make sure it is applied on column names and not columns.\nPrint the first 2 rows of the updated DataFrame.\n\n\n12.3.2.10 \nThe country names contain some special characters (characters other than letters) and need to be cleaned.

Save the cleaned dataset as population_data.\n\n\n12.3.2.11 Merging GDP per capita and population datasets\nMerge gdp_per_capita_data with population_data to get the population and GDP per capita of countries in a single dataset. Print the first two rows of the merged DataFrame.\nAssume that:\n\nWe want to keep the GDP per capita of all countries in the merged dataset, even if their population in unavailable in the population dataset. For countries whose population in unavailable, their Population column will show NA.\nWe want to discard an observation of a country if its GDP per capita is unavailable.\n\n\n\n12.3.2.12 \nFor how many countries in gdp_per_capita_data does the population seem to be unavailable in population_data? Note that you don’t need to clean country names any further than cleaned by the functions provided.\nPrint the observations of gdp_per_capita_data with missing Population.\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Merging datasets with similar values in the key column\nWe suspect that population of more countries may be available in population_data. However, due to unclean country names, the observations could not merge. For example, the country Guinea Bissau is mentioned as GuineaBissau in gdp_per_capita_data and Guinea-Bissau in population_data. To resolve this issue, we’ll use a different approach to merge datasts. We’ll merge the population of a country to an observation in the GDP per capita dataset, whose name in population_data is the most ‘similar’ to the name of the country in gdp_per_capita_data.\n\n12.3.3.1 \nProceed as follows:\n\nFor each country in gdp_per_capita_data, find the country with the most ‘similar’ name in population_data, based on the similarity score. Use the lambda function provided below to compute the similarity score between two strings (The higher the score, the more similar are the strings. The similarity score is \\(1.0\\) if two strings are exactly the same).\nMerge the population of the most ‘similar’ country to the country in gdp_per_capita_data. The merged dataset must include 5 columns - the country name as it appears in gdp_per_capita_data, the GDP per capita, the country name of the most ‘similar’ country as it appears in population_data, the population of that country, and the similarity score between the country names.\nAfter creating the merged dataset, print the rows of the dataset that have similarity scores less than 1.\n\nUse the function below to compute the similarity score between the Country names of the two datasets:\nfrom difflib import SequenceMatcher\nsimilar = lambda a,b: SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio()\nNote: You may use one for loop only for this particular question. However, it would be perfect if don’t use a for loop\nHint:\n\nDefine a function that computes the index of the observation having the most ‘similar’ country name in population_data for an observation in gdp_per_capita_data. The function returns a Series consisting of the most ‘similar’ country name, its population, and its similarity score (This function can be written with only one line in its body, excluding the return statement and the definition statement. However, you may use as many lines as you wish).\nApply the function on the Country column of gdp_per_capita_data. A DataFrame will be obtained.\nConcatenate the DataFrame obtained in (2) with gdp_per_capita_data with the pandas concat() function.\n\n\n\n12.3.3.2 \nIn the dataset obtained in the previous question, for all observations where similarity score is less than 0.8, replace the population with Nan.\nPrint the observations of the dataset having missing values of population."

    "section": "4.4 Specifying Your File Path",
    "text": "4.4 Specifying Your File Path\nNext, we will discuss how to specify file paths in Python for loading and saving data, with an emphasis on absolute and relative paths. File paths are crucial when working with files in Python, such as reading datasets and writing results to files. Let’s explore the difference between absolute paths and relative paths.\n\n4.4.1 Absolute Path\nAn absolute path provides the complete location of a file or directory from the root directory of your file system. It is independent of the current working directory.\nExample of an Absolute Path (Windows):\n# Absolute path example (Windows)\nfile_path = r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\data.csv\"\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n!conda env list\n\n# conda environments:\n#\nbase                  *  C:\\Users\\lsi8012\\AppData\\Local\\anaconda3\n                         c:\\Users\\lsi8012\\Documents\\Courses\\STAT303-Fa24\\stat303_conda\\.conda\n\n\n:::\nThe path associated with each conda env is absolute path.\n\n\n4.4.2 Relative Path\nA relative path specifies the file location in relation to the current working directory. It is shorter and more flexible since it doesn’t require the full path from the root.\nTo find the current working directory in Python, you can use either a magic command or a shell command, as shown below:\n\n\nCode\n# Magic command\n%pwd\n\n\n'c:\\\\Users\\\\lsi8012\\\\OneDrive - Northwestern University\\\\FA24\\\\303-1\\\\Week2'\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Shell command\n!cd\n\n\nc:\\Users\\lsi8012\\OneDrive - Northwestern University\\FA24\\303-1\\Week2\n\n\nExample of a Relative Path:\n\n\nCode\n# Example of relative path\nfile_path = \"sample.txt\"  # Relative to the current directory\n\n\nThe relative path sample.txt means that there is a file in the current working directory.\n\n\n4.4.3 Methods to Specify file path in Windows\nWindows uses backslashes (\\) to separate directories in file paths. However, in Python, the backslash is an escape character, so you need to either: * Escape backslashes by using a double backslash (\\\\), or * Use raw strings by prefixing the path with r.\n\n4.4.3.1 Method 1: Using escaped backslashes\n\n\nCode\nfile_path = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Username\\\\Documents\\\\data.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3.2 Method 2: Using Raw Strings\n\n\nCode\nfile_path = r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\data.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3.3 Method 3: Using forward slashes (/)\n\n\nCode\nfile_path = \"C:/Users/Username/Documents/data.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3.4 Method 4: Using os.path.join\n\n\nCode\nimport os\nfile_path = os.path.join(\"C:\", \"Users\", \"Username\", \"Documents\", \"data.csv\")\n\n\nThis method works across different operating systems because os.path.join automatically uses the correct path separator (\\ for Windows and /for Linux/Mac).\nmacOS does not have the same issue as Windows when specifying file paths because macOS (like Linux) uses forward slashes (/) as the path separator, which is consistent with Python’s expectations.\n\n\n4.4.3.5 Best Practices for File Paths in Data Science\n\nUse relative paths when working in a project structure, as it allows the project to be portable.\nUse absolute paths when working with external or shared files that aren’t part of your project.\nCheck the current working directory to ensure you are referencing files correctly.\nAvoid hardcoding file paths directly in the code to make your code reusable on different machines.\nUse the forward slash (/) as a path separator or os.path.join to specify file path if your code will work across different operating systems"
