    "## Setting Up Python Development Environment in VS Code using python `venv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `Spyder` and `PyCharm`, which are specifically designed for Python development, VS Code is a versatile code editor with multi-language support. As a result, setting up the Python environment requires some additional configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step-by-step guide will walk you through setting up your Python environment in Visual Studio Code from scratch using `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Python:**\n",
    "   - Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.\n",
    "   - Ensure that you check the box **\"Add Python to PATH\"** during installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Python Installation:**\n",
    "   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python --version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - You should see the installed Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Install Visual Studio Code Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open VS Code.**\n",
    "2. **Go to Extensions:**\n",
    "   - Click on the Extensions icon on the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`.\n",
    "3. **Install Python Extension:**\n",
    "   - Search for the “Python” extension by Microsoft and install it.\n",
    "4. **Install Jupyter Extension:**\n",
    "   - Search for the \"Jupyter\" extension by Microsoft and install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Set Up a Python Workspace for this course\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a New Folder:**\n",
    "   - Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your Python code for this course.\n",
    "2. **Open Folder in VS Code:**\n",
    "   - Go to `File > Open Folder` and select the newly created folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Create a Notebook for your work\n",
    "- In VS Code, go to `File > New File` and select `Jupyter Notebook`.\n"

    "###  Create a Python environment for your work - GUI method\n",
    "\n",
    " - When you start a Jupyter Notebook in VS Code, you need to choose a kernel. Kernel is the \"engine\" that runs your code within your Jupyter notebook, and it is tied to a specific Python interpreter or environment.\n",
    "    - **What's the difference between an interpreter and an environment?** An interpreter is a program that runs your Python code. An environment, on the other hand, is a standalone \"space\" where your code runs. It’s like a container that holds its own interpreter and environment-specific libraries/dependencies, so each project can have its own environment setup without affecting others.\n",
    "    - **Why do we prefer creating an environment for this course rather than using the global interpreter that comes with your Python installation?** As a data scientist, you may work on multiple projects and attend different courses that require different sets of packages, dependencies, or even Python versions. By creating a separate environment, you can prevent conflicts between libraries, dependencies, and Python versions across your projects ([dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell)) and also ensure code reproducibility. It is always good practice to work within python environments, especially when you have different projects going on.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   **Key Differences between `venv` and `conda`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Ecosystem**:\n",
    "   - `venv` is specifically for Python and is part of the standard library.\n",
    "   - `conda` is part of the broader Anaconda ecosystem, which supports multiple languages and is focused on data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Package Management**:\n",
    "   - `venv` relies on `pip` for package management.\n",
    "   - `conda` has its own package management system, which can sometimes resolve dependencies better, especially for data science libraries that require non-Python dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   . **Environment Creation**:\n",
    "   - `venv` creates lightweight virtual environments tied to a specific version of Python.\n",
    "   - `conda` allows you to specify not just Python but also other packages during environment creation, which can save time and ensure compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. **Cross-Platform**:\n",
    "   - Both tools are cross-platform, but `conda` is often favored in data science for its ability to manage complex dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **How to choose**\n",
    "   - Use `venv` for lightweight, Python-only projects where you want a simple way to manage dependencies. We are going with `venv` for our course.\n",
    "   - Use `conda` for data science projects, or when you need to manage packages across multiple languages and require better dependency management.\n",
    "   \n",
