    "    - If you see `(.venv)` at the start of the prompt, your virtual environment is active and matches the notebook kernel.\n",
    "    - If you see `(base)`, it means the base conda environment is active (common if you have Anaconda installed).\n",
    "    - To confirm which Python is being used, run:\n",
    "        - On macOS/Linux: `which python`\n",
    "        - On Windows: `where.exe python`\n",
    " \n",
    "> **Note:** If you have both Anaconda and VS Code installed, environments can sometimes conflict. If the terminal and notebook use different environments, packages may be installed in the wrong place, causing import errors in your notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Install packages with pip:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install numpy pandas\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " \n",
    "####  Installing from the Notebook\n",
    "You can also install packages directly from a Jupyter Notebook cell using a magic command. This is convenient for quick installs without leaving the notebook interface.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Add a new code cell and run:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    pip install numpy pandas\n",

    "## Dependency Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dependency conflict** occurs when two or more packages in your Python environment require different or incompatible versions of the same library.  \n",
    "This can cause errors, unexpected behavior, or even break your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do dependency conflicts happen?\n",
    "- Many Python packages rely on other packages (called *dependencies*) to work.  \n",
    "- If you install packages that depend on different versions of the same dependency, they may not work together.  \n",
    "- This is especially common in data science, where libraries evolve quickly and have complex interdependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Suppose you install two packages:\n",
    "- `PackageA` requires `numpy==1.24.0`  \n",
    "- `PackageB` requires `numpy==2.2.0`  \n",

    "- Export and share environment configurations for reproducibility\n",
    " \n",
    "**How conda prevents dependency conflicts:**\n",
    "- When you install a package, conda automatically checks for compatible versions of all dependencies and installs them together.\n",
    "- If a conflict is detected, conda will warn you, suggest solutions, or prevent incompatible installations.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Essential conda commands:**\n",
    "- Create a new environment:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " \n",
    "**Example:**\n",
