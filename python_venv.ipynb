    "## Dependency Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dependency conflict** occurs when two or more packages in your Python environment require different or incompatible versions of the same library.  \n",
    "This can cause errors, unexpected behavior, or even break your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do dependency conflicts happen?\n",
    "- Many Python packages rely on other packages (called *dependencies*) to work.  \n",
    "- If you install packages that depend on different versions of the same dependency, they may not work together.  \n",
    "- This is especially common in data science, where libraries evolve quickly and have complex interdependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Suppose you install two packages:\n",
    "- `PackageA` requires `numpy==1.24.0`  \n",
    "- `PackageB` requires `numpy==2.2.0`  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you install both with `pip`, the **last specified version wins**. One of the packages may then fail because it cannot use the version of `numpy` that was actually installed.  \n",

    "### How to avoid dependency conflicts\n",

    "- Create isolated environments for different projects\n",

    "- Create a new environment:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda create --name myenv numpy pandas matplotlib\n",

    "- Activate an environment:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
